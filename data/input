The Prince as Renaissance Literature
	The Prince, by Niccolo Machiavelli, is Renaissance Literature.  The entire book is largely focused on politics and how religion and classic tradition or antiquity should factor into it.  The Prince uses language to persuade and teach, as the whole account is a guide on how to rule.  It was written in Italian which was the vernacular for Machiavelli and all of the rulers to which the contents pertained.  The Prince is Renaissance Literature because it: is largely focused on politics, uses language to persuade or teach, and was written in the vernacular.
	The Prince is Renaissance Literature because it is largely focused on politics and how religion and classic tradition or antiquity should factor into it.  It was written as advice to a theoretical king that would unify the Italian states and drive out the foreign invaders.  As Machiavelli was a diplomat, he worked closely with many rulers and was able to see what did and did not work, therefore he had strong political authority.  Because of the political content and purpose of The Prince, it is Renaissance Literature.
	The Prince is Renaissance Literature because it uses language to teach and persuade.  He specifically references multiple kings and rulers and points out how their liberality or lack thereof affected their kingdom.  It is a literal guide on how to maintain and expand a kingdom.  Machiavelli uses strong persuasive language to emphasize and illustrate his point.  Because of Machiavelli’s aggressively persuasive writing style, it is Renaissance Literature.
	The Prince is Renaissance Literature because it was written in the Italian vernacular.  Machiavelli wrote The Prince for a nonexistent, ideal ruler who would unify the Italian states.  Therefore, it made sense for him to write it in the language of the nation which the ruler would unify, Italian.  As The Prince was written in the vernacular, as opposed to Latin, many more people were able to read and benefit from it than just those with higher education or religious affiliations.  Because The Prince was written in the vernacular, it is Renaissance Literature.
	The Prince is Renaissance Literature because it: is largely focused on politics, uses language to persuade or teach, and was written in the vernacular.  The Prince’s focus on politics is apparent through Machiavelli’s recognition of how people act differently than they say they should and how the church should be secondary to the state.  Machiavelli’s education and experience as a diplomat allowed him to effectively persuade and teach people through his writing.  Machiavelli was able to write so verbosely and well in part because he wrote in his native Florentine tongue.  Because of all this, The Prince is Renaissance Literature.

	Of all the characters of the various summer reading books that I have become familiarized with,
	Puck, from A Midsummer Night’s Dream, stands out as the most appealing to take the role of. His
	loyalty is appealing as it is a benevolent character trait. His mischievousness gives him a sense of humor
	as well as a taste for adventure. The assorted magical powers that the reader is aware of are also an
	enticing factor. Because of his Loyalty, mischievousness, and magical powers, I would want to become
	Puck.
	Puck’s loyalty gives him powerful allies and friends. In A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Puck serves
	as Oberon, the king of the fairies, servant. His loyalty is apparent when Oberon tells him to search the
	world for a magic flower and Puck returns with the said magic flower in less than an hour. He does this
	task willingly and with a positive attitude throughout. His enthusiasm is indicative of his of his loyalty.
	Puck’s loyalty is a positive character trait that makes him a character that readers would want to be
	transformed into.
	Puck’s mischievousness gets him into some trouble, but it also maintains his sense of humor.
	Puck, also known as Robin Goodfellow is, by nature, a mischievous sprite. He is known, amongst other
	things, to prevent housewives’ milk from turning into butter so that they are perpetually churning milk.
	His generally annoying antics are devilish but do not cause much real harm. Puck’s sense of humor is an
	appealing trait that makes readers want to become him.
	Puck’s magical power is the largest contributing factor as to why I would want to be transformed
	into him. He is a sprite who possesses magical powers. During the story, he turns Bottom’s head into

	that of an ass. The ability to transform other people’s figures into various animalistic features and any
	other magical powers that he may possess is extremely enticing. Puck’s magical powers are the main
	reason I would want to become him.

	Puck’s loyalty, mischievousness, and magical powers all lead me to want to take his role in A
	Midsummer Night’s Dream. The trust that is gained through loyalty is a tremendous benefit. His playful
	pranks, jokes, and sense of humor are harmless byproducts of his mischievousness. His magical powers
	are hands down the coolest trait of most of summer reading characters. If I had to take the role of any
	of the characters that I read about, I would want to become Puck.

The nature of Sacrament is unique in the sense that the physical manifestation of what it represents carries the same significance in meaning as the abstract idea that it is symbolic of.    Few other things share this characteristic.  One example of something that carries this dual nature is the concept of home.  While it is the physical establishment of residence and safety, it is symbolic of family, love, stability, and again safety, yet in a separate sense than the physical boundaries that comprise one’s home.  However, Sacraments have a specific purpose that distinctly sets them apart from relatively mundane things that share the dual symbolic and manifested significance that is present in such things like a house.  Sacraments can comprise of people, objects, or rituals, yet in order for these things to be considered sacramental, they must prepare us to receive God’s grace.  Unlike ordinary rituals which may be performed with or without specific religious intent, Sacraments are distinct celebrations of the opportunity provided by God for us.  They are simultaneously symbolic of and concretely identifiable as God’s grace which is offered to us through them.  Furthermore, Sacraments do not exist in independent, unrelated instances of this duality of nature.  They represent something that has existed in the past, is now made present to us, and will continue in the future.  This trans-temporal condition further develops the mystery of Sacrament.  They are symbolic of God’s love for us; they are God’s love for us.  A person can be Sacramental in the way that they live out their life in accordance with the teachings of the Church.  Although the most obvious example of a person being Sacramental would be a priest or some other members of the Holy Orders, the ability to both represent and make present God’s grace is not limited to them.  Lay people can be Sacramental in the sense that an ordinary person could not only act on behalf of the Church in performing service to his community, therefore representing the values of the institution, but the actions which he performs are also the physical manifestation of God’s grace.  Although this duality of nature is initially difficult to understand, it is at the heart of the nature of Sacrament.
Sacraments, as mentioned previously, are intended to bring us to a closer relationship with God.  However, as they are gifts of divine mystery, we as ordinary humans often struggle to fully grasp their nature.  As mechanisms used to confer the grace of God to us, Sacraments provide us with more applicable, concrete methods of understanding of God’s plan for us.     Fundamentally, things that are sacramental serve to aid us in achieving salvation as intended by God.  They are gifts from God, designed to bring us us closer to him.  For this reason, a public figure such as the president might be sacramental in nature in the sense that he both represents and is the product of Democracy.  However, he is not a direct syndicate of God designed to deliver salvation to all who encounter him, therefore he is not Sacramental.  That is what sets Sacrament apart from merely complex symbols.  Without Sacramental things and people, our interaction with God would be significantly lessened.  The necessity of Sacrament is revealed through the fact that our salvation relies almost entirely in our ability to experience and act in accordance with Christ in our daily lives.  Our participation in these opportunities is integral to developing our relationship with God as they affirm our devotion and gratification of God’s grace.  Furthermore, they allow us to offer more praise to God for blessing us with such welcoming gifts.  Simply, Sacraments have the effect of bettering our lives through participation in God’s love.
In conclusion, in order for something or someone to be Sacramental, it must be a physical sign of God’s grace that is also made present in itself, and it must also serve the purpose of bringing us closer to Him.

When considering the nature of the sacrament of the Eucharist, it is first necessary to define certain qualifying terms which can be used to characterize, although unable to holistically describe, the pinnacle of God’s love for his creation.  As It is the most benevolent, efficacious, and divine gift ever to be imparted to humanity, positive terms of goodness, truth, and beauty can be used to structure an appropriate lense of examination to further evaluate the nature of the Holy Eucharist.  The goodness of any gift, in this case the Eucharist, can be qualified by the degree to which it benefits its recipient.  The truthfulness of the Eucharist can be measured by the credibility of Its creator, as well as Its ability to fulfill Its purpose.  The final term, of an infinite selection of that would still fail to grasp the entirety of the mystery of the Eucharist, is beauty, which can be analyzed according to the circumstances which necessitate the gift.  Using these fields, the Eucharist can be framed as the most significant event of salvation history in terms of its legacy and impact on Christianity.  Because of Its good, true, and beautiful nature, the sacrament of the Eucharist is the source and summit of the Christian life.
As the enabling sacrifice allowing humanity to enjoy God’s presence in heaven, the Eucharist is not only good, but It is the best.  The self-sacrificial gift from God which was made present through the Messiah, Jesus Christ, opened the gates of heaven to all who had been awaiting salvation since man’s initial fall from God’s immediate grace.  Until Christ’s free submission to be sacrificed on our behalf, humanity had been suffering due to our innate concupiscence, indefinitely barring us from God’s presence.  Following his divinely orchestrated sacrifice, all the worthy souls of the deceased, both past, present, and future, became eligible to share in an unprecedented celebration of eternal happiness.  Furthermore, Christ’s institution of the Eucharist, the evening before his crucifixion, provided for all future believers to participate in and bear witness to the beauty of his sacrifice.  By symbolically breaking bread and sharing wine in accordance with Judaic tradition, but more importantly by performing the transubstantiation of the meal so that it became his body and his blood, Christ reappropriated multiple themes of his previous ministry so that we could understand the fullness of the action which he was undertaking.  One such motif, referred to as The Loop of Grace, describes a pattern which is revealed when man is given a gift by God, and, rather than accepting it for himself, returns the gift to God out of gratification, and is subsequently rewarded several times over.  This pattern is depicted several times throughout Christ’s ministry, with one of the most significant instances occurring directly after the Sermon on the Mount where Jesus multipltied the loaves and fish abundantly after the meager amount of initial food was turned over to him.  The summit of this process takes place at every celebration of the mass when gifts of bread and wine are brought to the altar where the priest then performs the transubstantiation, turning the mundane morsels into the divine body and blood of Christ.  This Real Presence is integral to Catholic doctrine, as it is the very basis of our salvation.  Through the saving nature of Christ’s self-sacrificial crucifixion for our sins, as well as his institution of the central piece of the mass, the Eucharist is not only qualifiable as a good gift, but, in relation to Christianity, it is the most good of all conceivable gifts.
Considering the extensive litany of prophecies foretelling Christ’s Paschal Mystery, as well as the nature of Christ’s divine origin, the fulfillment made possible by the Eucharist makes It an embodiment of truth.  The Eucharist has Its source in the ultimate creator: God.  For this reason alone, It is inerrant, without flaw, and cannot be conflated with error, nor to a more negative degree, fallacy.  However, from a strictly literal and chronological assessment, the Eucharist not only aligns with, but also fulfills, several scriptural passages preceding It in unmistakeable terms.  The book of prophet Isaiah is riddled with references to the coming of the Messiah as well as his suffering so that we may be healed.  With language as specific as is used in chapter 53, such as “pierced for our sins”, “given a grave among the wicked”, and “bore the sins of many”, which explicitly prefigures the Paschal Mystery, the truth of the Eucharist is affirmed by its own fulfilling nature.  In this sense, the Paschal Mystery, and therefore the Eucharist as well, are the summit of all the teachings and preparations of the Bible.  The centrality of sacrifice on behalf of sinners that is maintained through the Eucharist throughout salvation history elicits a degree of truth that is unmatched by any other deed.
	The Eucharist is surrounded by an essence of beauty which is as poetically tragic as it is joyful.  Christ, an unblemished mediator between God and Man, was sent by the Father after hundreds of years of man’s life in sin.  Sacrificing his own paternal love for the benefit of the rest of His creation, God allowed His son to be killed at the hands of the very people whom he was trying to save.  Christ himself submitted to the sacrifice on behalf of humanity freely; an act of humility which would evoke literary mimicry for millennia afterwards.  Subjecting himself to experience life as a human, whilst also retaining an elevated divine existence, Christ suffered intensely in an extraordinarily generous and beautiful sacrifice.  Once again, The Loop of Grace is present in Christ’s willingness to be sacrificed so that we may be healed.   Even if one tried to interpret the passion of Christ without religious context, a somewhat hopeless task, the narrative of a Father sacrificing his son for the greater good of humanity is an unavoidably beautiful story.  Furthermore, in order to prevent similar circumstances of sin separating us from salvation from arising ever again, Christ instituted the Eucharist.  Not simply a symbolic celebration, Christ’s transubstantiation, and further bequeathal of the continuation of the celebration of the Eucharist through the mass to the Apostles, removes any such disparity from ever coming between God’s love and our hearts.  Whether It is regarded simply as a story of sacrifice, or understood more fully as the Paschal Mystery, the Eucharist, and the events surrounding It, form one of the most sincere and beautiful love stories that humanity can benefit from.
	As both the source and summit of Christian life, the Eucharist is arguably the most crucial plank of Catholic Faith.  The Eucharist is both the reason for our salvation, as well as the height of our ability to experience God’s love for us on Earth.  The Eucharist is the source of our life as Christians as It IS the body and blood of Christ.  Through our consumption of the presence of Christ during the celebration of the mass, we participate in an unparalleled relationship with God which was made possible only through Christ’s sacrifice.  The Eucharist is the summit of Christian life as It is our primary opportunity to experience God’s love for us in our everyday life.  No other ceremony, prayer, or sacrament, brings us closer into God’s presence than our consumption of the Eucharist at the mass.  Here we are reminded of our sinfulness and,  more importantly, our opportunity for salvation, during the liturgy of the Word, reminded of Christ’s sacrifice at the Last Supper through the Liturgy of the Eucharist, and invited to participate in the celebration of the Communion.  The Eucharist is a primary reason to celebrate, as well as the designated means to celebrate God’s love for us.
	Because of Its good, true, and beautiful nature, the sacrament of the Eucharist is the source and summit of the Christian life. Understatedly described as good, The Eucharist is the embodiment of the divine Son of God.  A gift directly from the Father, and in alignment with all preceding biblical teachings, the Eucharist is true.  An undeserved and self-sacrificial gift, the Eucharist is beautiful.  Measured only by these three terms, the Eucharist stands out as the most significant gift ever to be offered to mankind.

	The Deafening Sound of Life : A Comparison of the Compson Brother’s Reactions to Tragedy
		Shocking literary aficionados of the era, Faulkner’s unorthodox novel recounting the happenings of a Southern family in the early 20th century shares much semblance with many of his contemporaries’ efforts to characterize the American psyche during that time period.  However, Faulkner breaks from many of the accepted literary standards and delves into a thought-provoking, dark saga divided across the four primary characters in the story.  Refusing to shy from the uglier aspects of life, Faulkner embraces several twisted and brutal plotlines continually baffling his audience.  In his cynical novel The Sound and the Fury, modern author William Faulkner juxtaposes the characters of Benjy and Quentin Compson in order to show that ignorance really is bliss, highlighting the inevitable tragedy of human existence.
	Although Benjy is able to delineate between certain central figures and memories, it is clear through the detached manner with which he describes the events in which he has found himself thrust that his mental disposition renders him oblivious to his surroundings.  Benjy’s chapter, unburdened with subjective judgment, reads directly as he perceives the world around him: mostly free of opinion.  These omissions prove to be integral to Benjy’s comparatively beneficial disposition to that of his brother’s.  As a critic from Johns Hopkins University Press James Mellard identifies, Benjy’s innocence is established by his separation from Time and Nature, the two fundamental ingredients necessary to experience tragedy (62).  Although he is arguably impartial, Benjy’s handicap noticeably prohibits him from forming holistic and accurate thoughts.  This is evidenced through his repeated expressions of sensory dysphoria, where he conflates multiple sensations into one feeling in a way that, were it not for his handicap, would be inexplicably incorrect.  Describing his perception of the harsh, frostbitten environment, Benjy recounts that he could “smell the bright cold” (Faulkner 6).  Reinforcing this aspect of Benjy’s distorted perception, Faulkner includes several other instances of this confused descriptive style, such as, “I could smell the clothes flapping” (14), and “the smoke blowing blue” (14).  Furthermore, Faulkner solidifies the characterization of Benjy as a disjointed klutz when he includes Benjy’s inner monologue recounting his reaction to an apparent burn, “My hand was trying to go to my mouth” (59).  By subjecting the reader to these inaccurate descriptions, Faulkner forces them to empathize with Benjy.
	 While the other Compson children are also unaware of the tragedy occurring upstairs, Benjy, although concurrently upset, is unaware as to why.  An attentive reader might be able to sift through the overlapping timelines to infer that the Compsons’ grandmother, referred to as Damuddy, is growing increasingly ill and dying.  Although it is not evident that Benjy himself is privy to this detail which proves to be the source of much instability in the family at this point in his life, he remembers dialogue implicating the arrival of funeral guests, “‘Do you want to make him sick, with this house full of company?’” (Faulkner 8).  Later on, as the children anxiously discuss the servant Dilsey’s cryptic instruction to remain silent, as well as the disturbing noise coming from upstairs, Benjy becomes distressed by the mysterious interruption, recounting, “then we heard it again and I began to cry” (25).  By conveying this sense of cluelessness, Faulkner captures both Benjy’s sensitivity as well as his separation from the tragedy unfolding within his own household.
	Among a throng of arguably negative aspects of his handicap, one of the more appreciable results of his mental disorder is a lack of empathy that prevents significant bias from staining his narration.  In that sense, the last section notwithstanding, Benjy’s chapter is the most direct and clear.  Although it is not immediately noticeable, there are no inferences as to the thoughts of the characters around him, only a relatively factual, yet fragmented account of his memories.  For example, although Benjy’s reactions to the happenings around him are usually exhibited by his uncontrollable crying, none of the dialogue relayed by him includes retrospective thought about the nature of the said dialogue.  Even to memory sequences which would usually elicit strong emotion, such as Caddy’s unpleasant sexual encounter with Charlie, Benjy volunteers no more commentary than the inclusion of his own crying, a reaction which is almost diluted because of its high frequency (Faulkner 47).  Although it does not immediately stand out, the prolonged absence of descriptors accompanying any of the dialogue in Benjy’s section serves the same purpose of sapping emotional distortion from his narration.
	Nevertheless, Benjy is not entirely detached from reality to the point where he remains unaffected by his surroundings.  In fact, he is one of the most reactionary characters in the entire novel.  However, even though he is disrespected and spoken down upon by many of the people he encounters, his recollection is not stained by how their actions affected him.  Benjy offers no evidence of his feelings being hurt, even after being treated like a vicious dog as a passing girl commented, “‘I’m scared to… I’m going to cross the street’” (Faulkner 52).   While his actions reflect his feelings, his narration does not.  Once again omitting any insight into his emotional state, leading the reader to question its existence, Benjy includes depressing conversations such as that between his mother and father, where his mother breaks down as a direct result of Benjy’s behavior saying, “‘I know I’m nothing but a burden to you… But I’ll be gone soon’” (62).  Passively participating in his own life, Benjy is shielded from the negative memories he has experienced and is not inhibited in his ability to carry on with his life, unlike his brother, Quentin.
	Educated yet obsessively narcissistic, Quentin, in contrast, is acutely aware of precisely every detail which has led to the unfortunate situation that culminates in his act of suicide.  Although peppered with occasional stichomythic dialogues barred from narrative description, Quentin’s chapter is comparatively bursting with imagery as he is consumed by a tragedy that occurs primarily in his mind. Quentin’s attention to detail and the ensuing introspective reflection starkly contrasts Benjy’s comparably shallow descriptions.  The first paragraph of the chapter opens with a description of Quentin’s watch, and includes his ponderings on the nature of time, foreshadowing the whole chapter, as he proceeds to try to escape time.  Ironically, Quentin recounts his father’s imparted wisdom, “I give it to you…not spend all your breath trying to conquer it” (Faulkner 76), which he proceeds to disregard for the duration of his section.  Overshadowed by this single passage, all of Quentin’s actions for the rest of the novel are framed by his neglect of his father’s advice, and his struggle to undo the past, brought about by his own arrogance of intellect.
	His narration becomes increasingly poetic as he approaches peak mental instability resulting in his death.  Immediately following his intense exchange with Dalton Ames, distinguished by its rapid dialogue, free of description, Quinten reverts to his calmer, descriptive voice saying, “Everything was sort of violet and still … without any wind” (Faulkner 165).  As his descriptions continue, his senses appear to transcend the conventional categorizations of imagery.  Synesthetically describing his environment as he becomes enveloped in his own train of thought, Quentin claims, “I could feel the water beyond the twilight, smell” (169).  With his narration becoming progressively more eloquent as his memory lapses between past and present, Quentin illustrates his surroundings in an interpretive manner such as, “between silence and nothingness… yellow and red and green… repeating themselves” (171), where he captures the essence of blinking lights under a bridge.  These refined descriptions break, and a realization is paired with a detachment from the conventional narration as Quentin determines that the only way to retain control of his life is to end it, saying, “every man is the arbiter of his own virtues” (176).  Although interspersed with confusing sections of memory and dialogue as Quentin torments himself with memories, the descriptions included surpass all efforts made in Benjy’s preceding chapter.
	Quentin is highly educated in comparison to Benjy.  His chapter flows poetically in contrast to Benjy’s butchered yet cut and dry section.  A Harvard student, and the Compson family’s poster-boy, Quentin overshadows Benjy by a significant margin, who, as the shame of the family, has received no formal education whatsoever.  His narcissism surfaces as he concludes that everything that troubles him is a result of his own actions, or lack thereof, whilst simultaneously pondering the tilted odds of life, contemplating the “dice already loaded against him” (Faulkner 177).  However, his over-dramatization of his surroundings and the situations he finds himself in make it difficult to tell what is truth and what is exaggeration.  As he approaches his fateful realization, Quentin includes such thoughts and observations of questionable validity amidst his otherwise artistic descriptions, recalling how he could hear “whispers secret surges smell the beating of hot blood” (Faulkner 176).  Capable of significantly higher thought processes than his handicapped counterpart, Quentin’s grasp of language has the adverse effect of his intention to clearly communicate his thoughts to the reader.  Rather, his use of imagery and description distracts the reader, as well as himself, from the actuality of his situation.
	Noticeably inept, Benjy’s disability, while not incapacitating, effectively separates him from the ugly reality in which he exists.  As one of the most distinct characteristics of any of the characters in the novel, Benjy’s detached narration is highly indicative of his disability.  Throughout Benjy’s chapter, several of his otherwise understandable descriptions of characters’ actions are marked by a stream-of-consciousness style that, although made in an effort to further elucidate a situation, sometimes result in obscuring the actual events being described.  Frequently defaulting to run-on sentences, as if to capture Benjy’s struggle to keep up with what is going on around him, Faulkner’s choice of style for Benjy’s narration often jolts the reader’s attempt to smooth over the intentionally choppy text.  Hurriedly, Benjy recalls, “Dilsey was there, and Father put me in the chair and closed the apron down and pushed it to the table where supper was” (Faulkner 24).  In this manner, as Benjy stumbles over his memories, forcing several actions and descriptions into one continuous thought, Faulkner conveys the confusion taking place within his mind.
	While Benjy’s narration has the broadest timeframe of information to relay to the reader, his chapter is composed of a series of fragmented memories all occurring out of order, yet being remembered interconnectedly.  Although initially appearing to be an indecipherable jumble of ideas, a discernable pattern of sensory input triggering his memory arises.  Provoked by the cold, “You dont want your hands froze… ‘It’s too cold out there’” (5), provoked by the water, “I hushed and got in the water and roskus came” (17), and provoked by odors associated with Caddy, “Caddy smelled like trees… She smelled like trees” (43-48), Faulkner helpfully includes certain habits which give structure to otherwise disorienting passages.  Benjy’s reliance on sensory association to denote significant memories from those that did not strike him enough to retain them help to further structure the reader’s understanding of Benjy’s mental situation.
	Although Benjy is seemingly impervious to many of his immediate surroundings, he exhibits an acute and unusual awareness to certain details, albeit distributed over an extended amount of time.  Contemporary critic Michael Millgate explains how the summation of Benjy’s existence within the novel is spread out across many points in time which reveals key aspects about his character, asserting that “occasional italicization should alert the reader to the kind of process going on in Benjy’s mind” (99).  Millgate proceeds to enumerate the eight specific points in time which define Benjy’s character, noting how the transitions between memories are often accompanied by a leap from traditional Roman type to italics.  However, in alignment with the confusion associated with Benjy’s character, this is not a steadfast restriction.  Faulkner occasionally cloaks Benjy’s thoughts in italics, even though they appear to be taking place in the present memory, rather than being used as a transition into a another.  When recalling the supper conversation between Quentin and his father, Benjy’s memory lapses into italics, “Hello, he said.  Who won. ‘Nobody’” (Faulkner 67), without breaking away from his current memory, only serving to provide a semblance of a blurred recollection which is strongly implied by the fragmented nature of Benjy’s section.  Although Faulkner offers a myriad of guiding clues to help translate this chapter, a considerable amount of red herrings are also included, making it one of the most challenging timelines to grasp.
	Sharing semblance with his handicapped counterpart, Quentin’s chapter also includes lapses in syntactical correctness as he struggles to retain details during some of the intense sequences of his timeline.  His inner turmoil is revealed in the tormented manner to which he often reverts, either when his negative thoughts are spiraling out of control, or when anxiously speeding through a past memory.  Most identifiably, his syntax frequently implies that he is disgruntled, either recollecting in a blur, experiencing in a daze, or just drunk.  Repeating himself, and trying to suppress the shameful conversation, Quentin’s account reads, “I said I have committed incest… Roses.  Cunning and serene” (Faulkner 77).  Spanning numerous pages each, two of the most notable abandonments of syntactical guidance take place as Quentin recalls his intense duel with Dalton Ames, “I saw you … enough of that last summer” (Faulkner 107-111), and during his unholy act with Caddy, “One minute… beating against my hand” (Faulkner 149-164).  Both of these excerpts stand out from the rest of the novel as they are designated by multiple consecutive pages with no punctuation whatsoever.  Faulkner further clouds the recollection of both transgressions by having Quentin oscillate between dialogue and description, forcing the reader to reread the passages multiple times, just as Quentin is forced to relive his memories perpetually.  While this method is highly unorthodox, its execution is masterfully woven into the very nature of Quentin’s character, delineating his thought process from that of the other three perspectives in a truly unforgettable style.
	After the most significant exhibition of the aforementioned stichomythia, Quentin’s memory jumps between a plethora of styles, indicative of his ongoing mental breakdown.  It falls back to the familiarity of academic description, then subsequently regresses into drunken rambling as he finally becomes aware of his subconscious conclusion that the only way to escape himself is to die.  His thoughts mingle together as he becomes increasingly enthralled in the potential escape that suicide offers, aided by his implied of consumption of alcohol, “that liquor teaches you to confuses the means with the end  I am. Drink” (Faulkner 174).  Interspersed in the subsequent drunken ramblings are snippets which give much insight into his impaired thought process, such as, “the strange thing is that... will not face that final main” (177).  Finally, set apart again by a familiar and conventional style of writing, the last paragraph of the chapter leaves the reader with a chilling sense discomfort caused the calm state of mind that has befallen Quentin in his final memory.  Only able to find peace in death, Quentin returns the watch to his dresser drawer, symbolizing his surrender to time. Ultimately, Quentin’s implied suicide delivers an impactful message about Faulkner’s perception of the  the inevitability of suffering in human life.
	The unfortunate Compson brothers in William Faulkner’s The Sound and the Fury capture the ugly nature of human vitality.  By impairing the point of view that the reader must experience Benjy’s memories of the Compson household through, Faulkner leads the reader to appreciate a sense of calm that is not shared by his brother’s chapter.  This drab narration, although it hardly reveals any perceptions of happiness, when juxtaposed with the horrors of Quentin’s heightened intellect, comes across as a serene break from the madness of reality. Compared to Quentin’s tormenting conscience, Benjy’s obliviousness seems far more favorable. Masterfully crafting each of his characters around that which they cannot achieve, Faulkner identifies the emptiness that is consuming many Americans following World War I and leading into the Great Depression.  Rather than deliver an uplifting novel, however, Faulkner develops the fears and vices that he sees whittling away at the American psyche, projects them upon his characters, and lets the chaotic situation dissolve into disarray.

	I’d like to take this opportunity to thank all of the teachers, faculty, distinguished guests including his Excellency Bishop Burbidge, Dr. Bigelow, the Most Reverend Don Heat of the Oblates of Saint Francis De Sales, Dr. Curry,  Mrs. Tobin, friends, family, and most importantly of all: my fellow graduates! For being here this morning.  It’s not often that a student gets the chance to address his classmates, his classmates’ families, and even perhaps his classmates’ extended families, so bear with me.  I’ll admit that I have been known to filibuster for the sake of hearing my own voice --in fact, I’m too afraid to turn around to see how many teachers are staring daggers at me right now-- but I’ll try keep this short and sweet.

I’m going to talk about our perspective towards the obstacles that I know each of us has either experienced over the past four years, or will face sometime down the road in our lives.
I believe that the volition that defines our approach to these otherwise unpleasant realities determines how we make it out the other side.  Now, without being too verbose and cumbersome, It is first necessary to recognize how blessed we all are to be sitting here, looking pretty sharp in our graduation caps, gowns, assorted scholastic cords, and diplomas.  Go us.

According to the school website: “Bishop Ireton, a co-educational, college preparatory high school located in historic Alexandria, Virginia, began its proud heritage of academic excellence rooted in Catholic tradition in 1964.”  I wanted to unpack that description as, strangely enough, I think it’s an exceptional jumping off point to discuss the significance of our school and its role in our preparation for the next parts of our lives.

Bishop Ireton is “College Preparatory.”  Now, whether we realize it or not, Ireton has taught us many things over the past 4 years:

We learned about the sensitivity of fire alarms,
We learned how to cram 200 years of history into just
two hours,
We gained an acute awareness for just how long 48
minutes really lasts,
We’ve learned about Mitochondria, Pythagoras, the
Founding Fathers, literature ranging from the
Classicists to the contemporaries.

And we should be thankful for the opportunities afforded us to not only attend, but graduate from, a private school that offers such a wealth of other specialized classes to serve our outlying interests.
Although important and necessary, academic classes serve largely as the means by which lasting and developmental character traits have been imparted to us.  Therefore, and perhaps most importantly of all, we learned about the power of community.

I would love to explain how a litany of virtues are expressed by the the Class of 2018, but I think I’m only allowed to talk for about an hour, so I’m going to focus on one in particular: and that’s Courage.  The reliably benevolent characteristic in question can be found in every encounter with any Ireton student.  This strength of our Class, and our school community as a whole, is predicated upon the classroom environment which is rooted in Catholic Tradition.

I think it’s important to clarify that Courage has everything to do with our approach, and nothing to do with the object matter of the obstacle, and it comes in many forms.

It might be trying out for a sport you’ve never played
before,
Securing the lead role in a theatrical production with
no previous acting experience,
Starting a club to develop your interests without
knowing where it will take you,
Enduring the next 56 minutes of my speech,
Or even just opting to sacrifice 15 minutes that could
be spent in the warmth of your bed in order to get
to school early to study for a test.

Courage doesn’t necessitate performing heroic and terrifying deeds of epic proportion in the face of danger.  I mean it might, but it is also expressed in the mundane tasks we carry out in our day-to-day lives.
It means having the will to try to overcome an obstacle in your life, and doing so freely.

According to the aforementioned blurb from the website, Ireton’s efficacy as an educational institution is “Rooted in Catholic Tradition.”  This is largely due to the cooperation between the teachers and faculty and the students to integrate our Catholic Faith into everything we do as a school.  This sense of community would not be possible without either side of that equation: the efforts of the teachers, and the eager reception of the students.  Formation of character begins at home and it is a blessing to be able to appreciate a continuation of the instillment of those values at school.  For example, many of us find comfort in the structure of the day which begins and ends with prayer -- a reflection of the ideal prayer life that many of us were taught to maintain from a young age.
Our uniting faith is the backbone of our community.  And although opportunities for mass, adoration, service, the March For Life, and religious retreats present themselves as obvious examples of the breadth of our Salesian community, the most resonating demonstrations of virtuous practice have been student led efforts, both spontaneous and deliberate.

This year, in the wake of tragedy, the student body as a whole, but especially through the leadership of our class, came together to offer focused prayers for the lives lost in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Shooting.

We came together in tremendous support for one of
our classmates and his family after a tragic loss.

… And not shortly after, you came together in
tremendous support again, for me and my family.
And I cannot thank you enough for that…

This is not just a graduating class of a Catholic school.  This is a community of individuals who embody the characteristics espoused by the prayers and practices we share; who will support each other in times of need;  who go out of our way for each other;  who resemble a family more than a class.

Rather than adopt an approach of resignation in the face of any of these obstacles, we have demonstrated courage.  Courage to not only carry on, but to lift up those around us as well in our pursuit of success, whether it be moral, academic, athletic, or spiritual.  While we are responsible for maintaining this strength within our community, it would be quite an exaggeration to claim that it began with our class.

According to the blurb from the website, the school was “[founded in] 1964” - meaning that we are the 50th graduating class of Bishop Ireton since the inaugural graduating class of 1968, many members of whom are joining us here today.  The approach of the alumni who first walked in, and first walked out, of the familiar doors of Bishop Ireton are reminiscent of the Old Testament figure of Abraham (and not because he lived to be 175 years old).
Abraham, the Sojourner of the Unknown, is the manifestation of several ideals present within a good role model, including courage.  However, he was not without sin, not by a long shot (and thank goodness for that, right?).  Yet, he was arguably the most successful protagonist of the Old Testament: Holder of the Covenant, Father of Nations, Master of the Unknown.
In the book of Genesis, we learn how Abraham responded to the divine instruction of God, dropped everything, and travelled to the foreign land of Canaan.  He rescued his nephew, Lot, from tribal warlords in the land of Sodom with only 318 men of his house.  He bartered with God in an attempt to prevent the destruction of Sodom if only 10 good men could be found within the corrupt city.  Abraham became the leader of what was once the foreign land of Canaan, and established his house as a beacon of followers of God, partakers in the covenant.

An excerpt from the book of Hebrews chapter 11, verse 9, reads: “By faith he made his home in the promised land like a stranger in a foreign country;” The Story of Abraham --who entered into strange lands, mastered them, and lifted up those within them-- is not dissimilar to the story of the Class of 1968 who we are pleased to celebrate our graduation ceremony with today.

Now, most of us came into high school knowing nothing about anything, let alone what to expect for the next four years of our academic careers.  I was homeschooled through the 8th grade, but I still don’t think that I can fully relate to the sense of foreignness that the Class of ‘68 must have experienced.  They entered into a brand new school, a clean slate, a “foreign land.”  There was no mascot, no school colors, no traditions, no community.  Not only did the Class of 1968 experience the full degree of the “unknown” that must have permeated the walls of the school 50 years ago, but they embraced it; They voluntarily sought it out, many of them paying for their own tuition working multiple jobs on the side.
I’d like to think that I had a pretty solid freshman year: participated in a few clubs, got good grades, got a Varsity Letter, you know --but I didn’t literally invent the school’s culture from the ground up while working 20 hours a week, all while making the Honor Roll.  However, several of the alumni amongst you today did just that.  The Abrahamic attitude of courage to embrace the unknown is personified by their attitude and approach towards the unknown.  Among them are Nuclear Engineers, Entrepreneurs, Computer Scientists, Businessmen, and Outstanding Fathers and Husbands.  Each of them shares the common characteristic of courage.  Courage to walk in the land of the unknown (I think it’s called the Oblate House now), and to lead the way for all subsequent classes.


They made some of their best friends at Ireton, and, in just four years, established a community that has lasted a lifetime and continues to serve those who are fortunate enough to participate in it as well.  That’s us: the direct beneficiaries of the efforts of the Class of 1968.  And for that, I think that they are very deserving of a round of applause.  While, compared to being stranded in the desert for 40 years, high school is a pretty trivial “foreign land” --still well within the confines of safety and inherent goodness-- the underlying theme of voluntarily choosing that which is unsettled, unproved … that which is unknown, has been ingrained into the culture of the Ireton Community from the outset, and I see it evidenced through the efforts of the Class of 2018.


Modernist author of the 20th Century William Faulkner said “You cannot swim for new horizons until you have the courage to lose sight of the shore.”  Now that we’ve graduated and we know everything, it’s time to depart from the familiarity of the shore, and conquer the new horizons.  It’s time to conquer the unknown.  For the overwhelming majority of us, the most immediate horizon will be college.  To be honest, I’m not too worried about college.  If we were able to memorize the quadratic formula, the role of the RNA in protein synthesis, all the effects of the Sacraments, and all the Amendments -- then how much harder can college really be… right?

No, the thing which would concern me, and which will persist throughout the rest of my life, is my ability to maintain the positive characteristics I would attribute to my time at Ireton.
To continue to be a good person.  But thanks to the values of discipline, integrity, and work ethic, as well as my Catholic faith, all of which were solidified over the past four years, I’m not concerned to face the future.  I’m excited to lose sight of the shore and swim for new horizons, because I know that when the waters get choppy, as they inevitably will, I’ll have a lifeline to you, my classmates.  The past four years have seen some of our best achievements, but we’re just getting started.

Continue to be thankful, continue to be prayerful, and continue to be courageous.

Thank You

On the Human Condition: Duration and the Mundane in the Works of Powell and Woolf
	Following the turbulence of the Great War, literature began to struggle with questions regarding the meaning of life.  Out of the existentialism which gripped many authors of the early-to-mid 20th Century was born the modernist movement which grappled with similar questions of existence and meaning in a world that seemed deprived of any semblance of optimism or fulfillment.  Two such authors include Virginia Woolf, considered to be a pioneer of British Modernism, and Anthony Powell, perhaps the greatest expositor of Western Culture in the past 100 years of English literature (cite steg notes).  Each of these two prolific authors have been lauded for their contributions to literature, and in light of the hundreds-of-thousands of words they left behind, the appearances of their prognoses on the human condition within their writings are no mistake.  Whereas Virginia Woolf’s Mrs. Dalloway touches on aspects of tragedy far more explicitly than Anthony Powell’s A Question of Upbringing, the latter novel more successfully address the human condition which is revealed through the characters which compose its plot.   Although the author of each novel strives to convey a message about the human condition, whether it be overtly bleak or hidden behind scattered layers of setpieces, Anthony Powell’s sage, retrospective tone in A Question of Upbringing elevates the novel’s capability to address the human condition.
Because of the radical characteristics which define her characters in Mrs. Dalloway, Virginia Woolf’s novel fails to serve as an accessible means by which she is able to convey her understanding of the tragedies of the human condition.  Although commentary on the state of society and its struggle to find meaning and fulfillment in post-war life is engrained throughout the narration and dialogue, the potentially enlightening conversations which carry this weight are delivered between a diverse, yet uniformly inaccessible set of characters.
The titular protagonist, Mrs. Dalloway, herself is an aristocratic member of the upper class and, while her inner struggle to discover a set of values to give meaning to her otherwise ambivalent existence far transcends its materialistic expression through concerns for her dinner party and relationship with her husband, the conflict which drives her involvement in the plot is posh and on the surface appears trivial.  Even though revelations about the significance of Clarissa Dalloway’s love for her husband Richard are made throughout the novel, culminating with the assurance of her satisfaction and fulfillment in life through him as she remarks “If Richard had not been there … she must have perished” (Woolf 185), she is surrounded by several other similarly elite members of society such as Lady Bruton, Hugh Whitbread, and Sally Seaton, who share the disposition of appearing removed from legitimate issues within society, but who are barred from the same level of character development as Clarissa, and therefore read as dry and disingenuous.  Woolf’s reflection on finding fulfillment in the human experience is shrouded by the pomp of the characters through which she conveys her.
On the other end of the spectrum of inaccessible characters within Mrs. Dalloway fall Septimus Warren Smith and Peter Walsh: two men defined by people they have lost.  Septimus, although one of the most compelling characters within the novel, fails to represent a relatable means of interacting with the human condition of loss and interpersonal relationships for the vast majority of readers.  Portions of the novel from his perspective which depict a visceral and tragic struggle with the human condition such as “He had been killed in the war.  But such things happen to everyone” (Woolf 66), offer explicit and universal, albeit extreme, examples of an individual’s experience of existentialism.  Conversely, Peter Walsh represents the extreme of an individual letting a single, far less significant, loss define and corrode his character throughout the novel.  Although the heartbreak he experienced at the hands of Clarissa does not lead to as tragic an ending as that which befalls Septimus, his struggle persists throughout the entirety of the novel, consuming him, and, with the last sentence of the novel jettisoning his inner turmoil into the future with “For there she was” (194), Woolf indicates that he, too, fails to resolve his conflicted emotions towards Clarissa.  Because of the the implication drawn from the fact that Woolf’s characters’ struggles are so monumental that they occupy a whole novel, but only transpire in a single day, her novel fails to address the human condition experienced through the mundane and day-to-day lives of the non-affluent, non-handicapped, and the non-heartbroken.
To contrast, in the first novel of his twelve-book saga, Anthony Powell succeeds in conveying a far more concrete message on the same struggle regarding ambiguous meaning in life and interpersonal relationships due to the scope of the novel and the accessibility of the characters.  Although many of main characters are still affluent and aristocratic--boarding and graduate school boys from wealthy, political, or militaristically important families--they do not share the mark of wealth which defines many of the struggles of the similarly affluent characters within Mrs. Dalloway.  Instead, their issues are anchored to their relationships towards one another.  There also exists a broader spectrum of comparably ‘normal’ characters than in Woolf’s novel.  Characters in A Question of Upbringing are defined by traits such as the one-upmanship emulated by Stringham, the awkwardness associated with Widmerpool, or the doltish behavior of Templer.  These characteristics are manifest through individuals in each social class, regardless of their mental disability or financial capability.  Furthermore, these characters offer a depth of characteristics and behaviors which cannot be confined to a single descriptive phrase or anecdotal instance.  This range of personality exhibited by Powell’s characters is reinforced by Jenkins’ commentary indicating a future distinction from a character’s current attitude, such as “--as he then seemed--” (93).  Powell uses comparisons between characters such as “I began to think of him as really a more forceful character than Stringham” (101) in a way that more similarly resembles a reader’s own understanding of his own social circle than a narrator’s pedantic obligation to inform the reader.  Powell’s characters’ personalities are dynamically intertwined and defined relationally to one another in a way that Woolf’s characters are not.
Although, in the single book of twelve, none of Powell’s characters undergo the same degree of character development as Mrs. Dalloway or Septimus, the narration of their collective progression through life and the obstacles that they encounter along the way parallels the familiar human experience shared by readers of both Powell and Woolf’s novels.  Their struggles transcend the constraints of a single day, which is represented through the broader scope of Powell’s book which takes place over several years, rather than a single day with achronological memories and flashbacks.  The manner in which Powell chooses to extend the plot of even just the first book over the course of hundreds of days, rather than a single event and the events leading up to it as Woolf does, combined with the occasional commentary provided by the narrator Nick Jenkins such as “In those days that was all I knew about his family” (Powell 9), “nearly two years of silence” (63), and “Looking back … on that last night” (93) reveal his sage and retrospective tone which accounts for the long-term implications of the interactions between the characters.
Because of the range of characters in Powell’s novel, and the relational means by which he describes the obstacles they encounter in their lives, his novel A Question of Upbringing more successfully addresses the human condition with regard to finding meaning and fulfillment through interpersonal relationship than Virginia Woolf’s Mrs. Dalloway.

The Post-Revolutionary Literary Revolutionary
	The thirst of party leaders after power was also utilized by King Farouk to realize 	personal ambitions at the expense of the vital interests of the people. He claimed 	exemptions from taxation and got control of thousands of acres of state property and 	entailed land. Merit was no criterion for rewards, nor was there any equality of 	opportunity; privileges were reserved for relatives and favorites of ministers in power. 	The results were nepotism and corruption. Egypt had a working constitution, but it veiled 	arbitrary rule.
										 Gamal Abdel Nasser

Due to the focus on betrayal, crime, and disaffection with government that is etched into the pages of The Thief and the Dogs, it is no surprise that several of Naguib Mahfouz’s critics find themselves delving deep within the minutia of the novel in order to unpack their perceived meaning of the Egyptian author’s post-revolutionary novel.  One of the largest points of contention surrounds the nature of the protagonist: Said Mahran.  Anti-hero, victim, father, or dead-beat, critics from several camps have weighed in on what Naguib Mahfouz expresses through the pivotal narrator of the thrilling story.  While outlying focuses on religion, gender, and formalism share an interesting place on the stage of Mahfouz’s Arabic masterpiece, most critics adopted post-structuralist or new historical approaches to understanding the influences which contributed to Mahfouz’s pointedly dejected tone that is revealed throughout the progression of the book.  Although disparate means are used to understand the purpose and meaning of the novel, each faction agrees about the end result --a revelation of existentialist concern for the state of man brought about by the worsened society in post-revolutionary Cairo-- and each acknowledges the validity, and even incorporates aspects, of other schools of thought.
 In rejecting the ideals of their structuralist predecessors, whose works are marked by a reliance on archetypal forms so as to give clear insight into the intended meaning of the piece,  the post-structuralist critics of Mahfouz’s The Thief and the Dogs integrate the theories of a variety of philosophers and approaches when tackling the complex and uncertain story, revealing the fundamental principle of post-structuralism: the meaning of the story is derived from the reader’s experience more so than an author’s predisposed intention.  While contemplation of the irrational, challenging of societal beliefs, and succumbing to the inevitability of human mortality are frequent themes referenced by Mahfouz and his contemporaries as identified by the post-structuralists, the diversity of their understandings of the meaning of the Egyptian thriller is evidenced through the specific points they raise in their analysis, demonstrating the depth of experience offered by a post-structuralist approach to literature. Critics including Dafer Al-Sarayreh, Oby Akhuemokhan and Sophia Okolocha, and Menahem Milson supplement their own ideas with those of Kant, Sartre, Camus, and Kafka in their dissections of Mahfouz’s tragic novel in order to bolster their arguments regarding the heart and purpose of the story which they claim are intentionally fleeting and intangible.  While Ami Elad focuses on Mahfouz’s characters’ propensity towards irrationality, the pursuit of love, and the exploitation of social hierarchies, Milson extracts the archetypes of alienation, existentialism, and dissatisfaction which define the author’s style.  Capturing the heart of post-structuralism, he characterizes Mahfouz’s understanding that “the quest for the ultimate truths may become sheer escapism” (185).  Each of the post-structuralist critics shares a focus on the unconventional methods Mahfouz employs in order to inform (or inversely shroud with confusion) the reader.
In binding works of literature to the culture, circumstances, and, in this case, conflicts which were transpiring when they were produced, critics of The Thief and the Dogs under the banner of new historicism (as well as several other schools of criticism) universally recognize the influence of the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 upon Mahfouz’s writings for the remainder of his literary career.  Muhsin Jassim Al-Musawi specifically recognizes The Thief and the Dogs as a turning point in the development of Arabic literature towards criticism of the complacency with the political totalitarianism which followed the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, arguing that, although previous authors expressed a similar frustration with governmental institutions, “it was Mahfuz who set the tone for the new mode of writing” (65).  David DiMeo provides biographical background about Mahfouz’s previous proliferation of criticisms of the corrupt Egyptian police state which collectively fell under the school known as al-adab-multazim, and how after the Revolution of 1952, Mahfouz translated the same feelings of distrust and disbelief in the efficacy of state institutions to such organizations composed of the proponents of the political activism he was so revered by, which are evidenced in The Thief and the Dogs.  Nathaniel Greenberg asserts that Mahfouz’s introspective and experimental tone is reflective of his belief that Egypt must repair itself before pursuing unfulfilling interests which Mahfouz metaphorically represents with religion.  Following a similar train of thought, Fatma Moussa-Mahmoud draws parallels between the protagonist “outsider,” Said Mahran, and the average post-1952 Egyptian, who also fails to experience societal familiarity.  While almost every critic acknowledges the historical context surrounding Mahfouz’s novel, these critics delve into the historical context with more detail than others.
Aside from the primary arcs of historical or post-structuralist criticism are outlying approaches to Mahfouz’s novel which, although incapable of holistically analyzing the purpose his novel on their own, serve to elucidate on specific aspects and techniques within The Thief and the Dogs.  Although the proceeding critics offer a diverse set of approaches into understanding Mahfouz’s writings, the trend of rejecting the traditional norms transcends the array of narrative choices and stylistic discrepancies on which they focus.  Michelle Hartman and Kamel El Saadany both hone in upon the unconventional role women and sexual relationships are treated by Mahfouz compared to the bulk of his Arabic peers.  Adel Elyas and Tawfiq Yousef apply formalist focuses on the importance of the unorthodox techniques Mahfouz employs in order to illustrate the mentality of his troubled protagonist, and revere him for introducing the primarily Western technique of stream-of-consciousness pioneered by William Faulkner into the Arabian sphere of literature.  Although referenced by several other critics, Rasheed El-Enany and Nedal Al-Mousa provide arguments about Mahfouz’s stance on the inefficacy of the established institutions, both governmental and religious, around which his criticism of religion is central. El-Enany argues that through Mahfouz’s frequent juxtaposition of creedal orientations, whether religious or communist in origin, none succeed in aiding his protagonists’ efforts and that the “message, as ever, is: if life has a meaning, it is to be found in and not outside it” (27).  Considering the complexity and ambiguity of Mahfouz’s novel, it is no surprise that several critics’ analyses of his post-revolution novel are less easily classified under a single school of literary criticism, and yet each aids in developing the reader’s understanding of the novel.
While post-structuralist critics argue that the flavor of Mahfouz’s novel stems from the experimental form, and new historical critics argue that the novel’s significance is due to preceding political conflict, and yet another motley camp of criticism remains irreconcilable with the rest, The Thief and the Dogs ages with a decidedly unusual classification.  Although the post-structuralist critics identify the necessity of uncertainty which Mahfouz employs to invoke a range of existentialist contemplations from the reader, the means by which he achieves this effect, albeit unconventional and unfamiliar at the time, becomes a structure in and of itself which serves to steer the reader towards a uniformly thematic ponderment of the purpose of life.  Critics such as Tawfiq Yousef and Adel Elyas recognize the significance of Mahfouz’s literature, specifically this novel, for introducing the Western technique of stream-of-consciousness into the Arabic stage of literature.   Therefore, through the use of the techniques identified by the formalist critics achieved through the integral role of the protagonist’s narrative perspective in The Thief and the Dogs, Naguib Mahfouz expertly utilizes modernist literature on the Arabian stage whilst simultaneously delivering powerful commentary on the state of affairs within Egypt.
	Firstly, Mahfouz writes from the perspective of Said Mahran, a jaded thief who was betrayed by his best friend Ilish Sidra, imprisoned for four years, and is released to a lackluster welcome, as his presumed friends and family are all absent.  The exposition of the protagonist, presenting Said as a vengeful ideologue molded by betrayal and hatred, is crucial as it places the reader, who is reliant upon Said for narration, at odds with nearly everyone he encounters whilst also forming the narrative view around a perspective of distrust and betrayal which poisons every observation and characterization made by Said.  In doing so, Mahfouz encumbers the reader with his own commentary about life in Cairo: everyone is lied to about how everything is ok, and therefore seduces themselves with lies of victimhood or complacency, evidenced by Said and Ilish respectively.
The introduction into Said’s perspective is bluntly made clear from the outset of the novel.  In just the first chapter, the reader learns of how Said’s wife, best friend, and daughter have all betrayed him.  On the first page of the story, Said’s distaste for society is made known to the reader as he internally reprimands the people passing by for looking unhappy, even though none of them could have “suffered more than he had, with four years lost, taken from him by betrayal” (Mahfouz 13).  The reader is subsequently informed of Said’s thirst for revenge upon those who were responsible for his imprisonment, as he broods about “When those who had betrayed him would despair unto death” (13).  Naming Said’s wife and accomplice at the time of his betrayal, Mahfouz sows the reader’s characterization of the protagonist as a man who has nothing left to lose (13).  This association is driven home when his daughter Sana timidly rejects his welcome in favor of her ‘treacherous’ mother, and established father-figure: Ilish.  Said reflects that “He felt crushed by a sense of total loss” (Mahfouz 19).  Over the course of only a few pages, Mahfouz clearly introduces the reader to the perspective of the ostracized narrator infused with hatred, betrayal, and anger.
This characterization of the unreliable protagonist whose self-destructive fallacies are augmented by the legitimate betrayal he experiences is compounded throughout the novel as Said attempts to regain a footing within society by reaching out to old friends.  In the third chapter, Said visits one of the local newspapers, Al-Zahra, in the hopes that his mentor from before his incarceration, Rauf Ilwan, could help him to get back on his feet.  Reminiscing on the “good old days” when he and Rauf both shared the disposition of peasantry and a distaste for the state, Said is soon reminded of the societal change that transpired while he was in prison as he receives strange looks from the well-dressed citizens within the office (Mahfouz 34-35). “Feeling alien and out of place,” Said retreats from the public setting in favor of a private meeting later that night (35).  However, Said’s hopes of returning to his familiar yeoman mentor are crushed when he finds that Rauf has become a member of the same elite class they used to scorn, marked by a “disturbing suavity, a quality which could only have come from the touch of blue blood” (39).  Countering the sense of legitimate betrayal imposed upon Said, the protagonist proceeds to revert to his criminal ways, attempting to steal from Rauf who, although changed and “Mephistophelean” (43) in manner, was nonetheless generous with Said, bolstering the hypocrisy of the narrating thief who is not above the betrayal he so vehemently denounces.
Completing the thorough circuit of betrayal that Said is subjected to, the story concludes with the final standoff between Said and the authorities which have caught up with him.  Mahfouz indirectly indicates that the final betrayal of Said’s whereabouts was executed at the hands of his prostitute love interest, Nur, who unceremoniously vacated the apartment she was sharing with him.  This detail is strongly implied by Said’s uncharacteristic and exaggerated trust in her which is revealed just before he finds that she has left the apartment as he internally serenades her: “I love you, Nur. With all my heart I do love you” (Mahfouz 150).  The fallacious monologue which drives Said throughout the entire novel is punctuated by his spiteful quips towards the police who surround him in the cemetery.  Even though he commits several legitimate crimes after his release from prison at the start of the novel, Said still views the authorities as an ever-antagonistic force which is motivated solely by his demise, rather than admitting that the source of his current predicament is his delusional belief that his profession is a “just and legitimate trade”(48).  Instead, he sarcastically cries “Justice indeed!” denying his moral impropriety and fulfilling the role of a victim to the very last (157).
Whilst Said Mahran is not honest with himself about the cause of his downfall, Mahfouz’s commentary on the capability of other institutions to lift the fallen Egyptian are not compromised by his narrator’s lack of integrity.  As David DiMeo suggests in his examination of Mahfouz’s criticism of the Egyptian police state throughout his novels, “the disillusioned characters of Mahfouz's post-1960 novels often isolated themselves from society” (6), brooding on the degradation of society by juxtaposing their pre- and post-incarceration experiences.  Mahfouz’s focus on the inefficacy and betrayal at the hands of religion, the state, and even his own friends as solutions to Egypt’s troubles which are metaphorically represented through the protagonist subtly expresses by contradiction where Mahfouz thinks the solution lies.  	Mahfouz’s stance towards Islam’s capacity to fulfill and fix Said is indirectly revealed through the protagonist’s interactions with the Sheikh.  While he seeks the Sheikh’s generosity and ability to offer him a place to stay, Said shirks the inherent nature of the place of worship, in search of an extra mattress rather than spiritual clarity.  The Sheikh identifies Said’s superficial requests, wisely remarking first that he seeks “the walls, not the heart,” and later “a roof, but not an answer” (Mahfouz 27, 29).  Mahfouz presents the potential solution of Islam in a fair light, yet the docile Sheikh who reappears throughout the novel in Said’s times of need serves as just another example of a complacent and inactive means of dealing with the underlying issues of corruption within the state and the disaffected society therein.
Mahfouz’s projected opinion on the failure of government is somewhat more tainted by the dishonesty of the narrator, but is still delivered with a heavy hand.  In the first chapter of the novel, his former partner in crime, Ilish, who is directly responsible for his initial betrayal is in company with a familiar detective.  Not only does the detective’s association with the abject traitor Ilish Sidra frame him in a negative light that has yet to be tainted by the narrative hypocrisy to follow, but his actions and characterization serve to express Mahfouz’s negative views of the state.  Quick to accuse Said of more crimes, the detective pats him down and unnecessarily calls Said a “cunning bastard” (Mahfouz 17).  His corrupt characterization is further compounded as presumptuous and obtuse when he fails to empathize with Said’s request to see his daughter, and later attempts to dampen the tense, yet civil, discourse between Said and Ilish (19).  Aided by the contextual knowledge of the revolution which historically would have transpired during Said’s imprisonment, as well as insight provided by critics such as David DiMeo who identifies “observations [within Mahfouz’s novels] about the societal damage inflicted by state brutality” (4), Mahfouz’s commentary on the failure of the state is punctuated by the fact that Said was betrayed by Ilish, and exits prison to enter a worse society where the fellow thieves have become state dogs.
Mahfouz’s dejected tone bleeds through the interpersonal relationships which Said destroys throughout the novel.  Betrayed by his family and closest friend at the outset, Mahfouz hints at the volatility of the social climate following the Revolution of 1952.  No one seems to be incorruptible in the new society into which Said is re-born.  Pejoratively expressing his disappointment with the poisonous effect of success and wealth upon Rauf Ilwan, he remarks about “how marvelous it is for the rich to recommend poverty to us,” indicating the divide that now separated him and his former friend (Mahfouz 45).  Lastly, Nur’s abandonment of Said leaves the broken criminal utterly alone.  The pattern of deceit throughout the novel serves to reveal the author’s pessimistic sense of helplessness and distrust in society under Nasser’s new regime.
The most important motif that pervades the series of betrayals is the tragedy of the protagonist which culminates with his death as the only man who seemed to recognize the issues at hand, revealing Mahfouz’s own disaffected and stranded stance.  In accordance with the aforementioned themes of alienation as identified by critics including Menahem Milson (181) and Dafer Al-Sarayreh (24), Mahfouz builds the conflict which his protagonist faces around a requisite sense of isolation.   Unable to find solace within the shelter of his home, a place of worship, or the company of old friends, Mahfouz’s sense of inability to enact meaningful change is evidenced through Said’s refugal evasion of an intangible and nebulous ‘state’ figure.  With the exception of the comparatively mild detective Hasaballah, none of Mahfouz’s antagonists are explicit members of ‘the state.’  All of the traitorous dogs he encounters are his friends; the state is merely responsible for the execution of their seemingly corrupt bidding.
	Mahfouz uses a stream-of-consciousness narrative style in order to emphasize the confused predicament of man versus society, versus the state, and versus himself.  His initially intimidating labyrinth of chronology and past memories molded with current monologue gives way to an unstructured structure which is symbolic of the mental depravity of Said and, in a metaphorical sense, Mahfouz’s own embittered self.  The reader is assaulted by out of place italics from the first page to the last.  At first, there is little-to-no distinction made between the significance of these bursts of slanted text.  However, after just the first chapter, the reader becomes familiarized with the overt designation of internal monologues which are signified by the italics.  With phrases such as “(I swear I hate you all.)” (15), to “Damn the man who lets himself be carried away by the melodious voice of woman.  But Said nodded in agreement” (19), Mahfouz establishes the unstructured structure of the protagonist’s mentality and, by extension, the novel as a whole.  After one particularly lengthy peek into Said’s raw and unfiltered consciousness, during which he contemplates the progression of his relationship with his wife Nabawiyya in the second person (90-96), Mahfouz mutates this style of interspersing Said’s thoughts between external interactions, by occasionally dropping the italics which previously helped the reader to distinguish reality from Said’s ramblings, marking his worsening mental state.  Adel Elyas identifies the transition from comparatively clear distinctions between the omniscient narrator who provides objective information about the protagonist and the stream-of-consciousness soliloquys to the stronger use of the technique later in the novel, which leaves the reader to serve as the juror of Said’s actions in absence of the omniscient commentary (24).  Remarking in the same manner which would usually appear beset by italics, Said remarks that there is nothing left to do but “crouch behind the shutters watching these endless progressions of death” (Mahfouz 101).  Because of the use of stream-of-consciousness which constrains the reader to the isolated and anxious perspective of the protagonist, the reader gains a more intimate understanding of him as the story progresses.
Although Mahfouz attacks the reader with such an unconventional and dynamic writing style, he also clearly guides the reader through an otherwise Faulknerian story (devoid of obvious contextual clues), heavily foreshadowing each step that Said takes towards his last.  Although Tawfiq Yousef argues that “the best and only example of [the experimental devices associated with Faulkner] is his novel Miramar” (44), similar techniques are not only present within The Thief and the Dogs, but they are the means by which the story retains its lucidity even through Said’s delusional monologues which are the source of the bulk of the narration throughout the story.  Mahfouz hints at what is to come through the internal observations made by Said, not only informing the reader, but compounding the tragedy of the protagonist who is responsible for the very observations which foreshadow his folly. While Said imposes himself upon his past mentor, he takes particular note of the expensive decor, “stealing occasional glances at objects d’art,” eyeing “a statue of a Chinese god,” and running his eyes “quickly over the smart drawing room” (Mahfouz 38-45).  Although Said ironically launches into the next chapter mentioning that he found nothing but betrayal within Rauf’s home, he proceeds to break in under the cover of the night only to be caught and released by a vindicated Rauf Ilwan.  Later on, during the aforementioned spout of italicized ramblings, Said offers a grim observation that “The silence of the graves is more intense… The flat must look the way it always has when Nur is out” (Mahfouz 95).  Unknowingly predicting the destination and cause of his death, Said foreshadows the final chapter of the novel.  Although Mahfouz often subjects the reader to Said’s convoluted perception of a situation, he includes numerous hints which supplement the narrow and tainted perspective.
Even though any obvious meaning of this Egyptian thriller is shrouded by themes of uncertainty, distrust, and existentialism which are compounded by the narrator’s intermittent bursts of stream-of-consciousness, Mahfouz delivers his commentary on the disrepair of the Egyptian socio-political climate whilst simultaneously establishing the means by which he is able to instill his readers with his own feelings of despair and disaffection as a legitimate literary structure. Even though Gamal Nasser stated that the revolution sought to “bridge the gulf between social classes and to foster the spirit of altruism which marks a cultivated individual” (208), it is clear through Mahfouz’s narrative choices in The Thief and the Dogs that he disagrees with the efficacy of Nasser’s revolution to reform Egyptian society.  Through the lens of the confused, criminal protagonist who conveys his own sense of disaffection, disgust, betrayal, and incapability, Mahfouz subtly argues that it will take more than a new regime to resolve the corruption present within his country.

Although, at face value, the answer to the posed question only decides which fruit to indulge in at any given time, the process by which that solution is achieved is far more rewarding than the juicy treat yielded by the initial inquiry. In accident, the two items are quite similar. They are both small, brightly colored, juicy, equally affordable, healthy fruits. Neither one possesses an objectively superior quality which would advance it in the hierarchy of otherwise equally delectable fruits. In essence, however, one may be much more preferable to its consumer. Although the decision between two good things ought to be easy, it is often, in fact, the hardest. As human beings with extensively complex consciences, decisions between an objectively good and bad thing are comparatively easier to make than those choices we make which have no impact on our moral status or those around us. There is no empirically accepted metric by which the average, non-citrus-allergic human being can inherently compare the meaningful goodness of two things as similar as apple and orange. Thus, human beings’ thoughts are far more susceptible to being hijacked by the contemplation of which fruit to omit from their salad, than they are to struggle with Solomonic moral dilemmas regarding the splitting of babies. Therefore, the best way to analyze two similar and morally irrelevant objects is to assess their ability to fulfill their purpose relative to the individual affected.

Luckily for the indecisive and hungry thinkers of the 21st century who find themselves stuck between the ongoing internal struggle between red and orange, the German philosopher Edmund Husserl pioneered an appropriate framework which can be used to begin to assess such seeming equivalencies as apples and oranges known as phenomenology. In attempting to achieve an objective determination, Husserl thought it was first necessary to not only acknowledge our own subjective biases which impact our decision making, but to embrace them, so as to strip away all the additives which contaminate our perception of an object’s or experience’s essence. Expanding upon this means of analyzing the world around us, I would argue that these biases, although menial when taken by themselves (orange or red, needs peeling or can be eaten whole, sweet or tangy), carry the most weight when acknowledged collectively according to the individual. By departing from the objectivity-driven quest for certainty pursued by the phenomenological lens of Husserl and those who followed him, in favor of a focus on those subjective qualities we, as fruit consumers, ascribe to our agonizingly tantamount produce, a relativistic structure of thought can be used to reveal the the solution as to which fruit we ought to choose. Whereas Husserl’s phenomenological approach still attempts to yield an objective answer through acknowledgement and subsequent removal of subjective factors, I think that these subjective factors provide the most informative measure of a fruit’s efficacy to satiate the individual’s desire.

When picking between an apple and an orange, perspective is everything. Edmund Husserl’s phenomenological approach to analyzing the nature of an experience according to the extensive context by which it is observed can only get us so far when examining things of such little consequence as fruits. When faced with the crux of Granny Smith or Clementine, and after reducing either to a lump of its essence --the sum of only its eidetic parts-- how could anybody enjoy either? If an object is only comparable according to its ability to fulfill its purpose as defined by its user, don’t let the question consume you; consume the apple (or orange if that’s what you prefer).

The author of the Gospel of John compiled his narrative as an explicit revelation of the identity of Jesus: the Word of God. John’s unique narrative does not weaken Jesus’ capabilities as the Messiah. In many ways, John’s Jesus is more divine than in the other Synoptic Gospels. The implication of his divine origin and purpose are established from the outset, in the Johannine Prologue. The next section of the Gospel is marked by its focus on Jesus’ signs which he performs to reveal himself as “the Son of God,” “the Bread of Life,” and many other titles indicative of his voluntary and sacrificial purpose. Along with its three corroborating texts, John’s Gospel climaxes with its own Passion narrative which teleologically supports Jesus’ purpose as the savior.

The poetic verses which open John’s Gospel thrust Jesus’ divine nature upon the reader by associating ‘the Word’ with God. Although this title is not claimed by Jesus anywhere else in the Gospel, the message that he espouses, that he is the conduit by which humans can abide in God, parallels the divine genesis offered by the Johannine Prologue. The third verse: “All things came into being through him, and without him not one thing came into being,”1 sets the tone of the subsequent narrative, in which Jesus recapitulates his unique relationship with the Father, as the Son of God with God, and the importance of that relationship for the salvation of man. Another notable phrase of this prologue which establishes the purpose of John’s Gospel occurs in the following verse: “In him was life.”2 This ‘life’ is referenced throughout Jesus’ public ministry and is expounded upon as “eternal life,”3 attainable only through Jesus. The Johannine Prologue lays the framework for John by establishing Jesus as the logos.

The next section of the Gospel holds the accounts of Jesus’ public ministry which are divided by signs, serving to reinforce his origin from the Father and his role as the savior. Use of the term ‘signs’ in reference to Jesus’ miracles is not unique to John’s Gospel, but the underlying purpose of the term as a sign of God, rather than a demonstration of power or an altruistic deed, is not emphasized as heavily in the other Gospels.4 Although Jesus claims to be the Son of God, his repeated attribution of the signs to “the one who sent [him],”5 balances the otherwise wholly divine figure, giving John a simultaneously high and low Christology.6 Each of John’s seven signs is performed so that witnesses might believe in Jesus. Before healing a Galilean official’s son, Jesus says: “Unless you see signs and wonders you will not believe.”7 The official believes him, his son is healed, and his household then believes as well. The emphasis is repeatedly placed upon Jesus’ origin, the Father, and his motivation for performing the signs, to convince people to believe in him. This is explicitly stated in the last verse of John 20: “These are written so that you may come to believe … and that through believing you may have life.”8 The emphasis of Jesus’ role as a conduit for salvation is developed through his signs as well. His title as the “Bread of Life” is revealed in the 6th chapter, where Jesus tells a gathered crowd: “The bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh,”9 continuing the thematic necessity of Jesus for mankind to experience eternal life. He says: “Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood abide in me, and I in them.”10 His ministry is centered around inviting mankind to share the communion with God that is described in the Prologue. There is no ambiguity about Jesus’ identity or purpose; John’s seven signs express Jesus’ purpose as the logos who confers eternal life.

Jesus undergoes his passion with a triumphant temperament indicative of his omnipotent understanding of his purpose. After entering Jerusalem, he rebukes himself, saying: “It is for this reason that I have come to this hour,”11 demonstrating acceptance of his fate, knowing he will be united with God. Furthermore, a voice from heaven responds, reinforcing Jesus’ missionary purpose: that they might believe.12 Before Judas betrays him, Jesus prays to God “on behalf of those whom you gave me,”13 that they might abide in God too. Finally, John describes Jesus’ death as a voluntary forfeiture of his spirit after declaring “It is finished.”14 Jesus’ death is a described as the completion of his mission rather than an unfair demise.

John’s Gospel characterizes Jesus as the forthcoming Messiah whose flesh and blood are the means by which mankind can partake in the communion with God described in the Johannine Prologue. It establishes that the Word, Jesus, was with God in the beginning, that his ministry ties him to the Father and invites other to share that communion, and that his passion was a culmination of purpose. John’s Gospel reveals Jesus’ identity as the logos.

rior to Judaism, but it fulfills all they desire in Judaism. Written during the late 1st century when Christians came under fire from Roman authority and Judaism stood out as a similar, enticing religion –free from persecution– the anonymous author urges his audience not to fall away from their faith.1 His exhortation is steeped in Jewish imagery and recapitulations of Old Testament history. By drawing on the best aspects of Judaism that his audience was attracted to and explaining why Christianity is better, the author aims to strengthen his Roman church during their struggles. The pseudo-epistle focuses first on Jesus’ fulfillment of several roles of Old Testament figures. It then explains how, through his fulfillment of these roles, Jesus introduced a new, eternal covenant replacing the old covenant: Jewish law. He concludes his remarks by praising the faith of a litany of Old Testament figures, urging his audience to likewise embrace the faith of their Christianity and persevere.

To demonstrate the superiority of Christianity, the author juxtaposes the missions of influential Old Testament figures against Jesus’ own sacrificial purpose. The first seven chapters of the sermon rely on Jewish scripture as a backdrop to illustrate Jesus’ existence as “the reflection of God’s glory,”2 “the pioneer of salvation,”3 and the high priest of their faith.4 The author introduces these figures to show the ubiquitous fulfillment of Jesus’ passion and resurrection. By rhetorically praising the actions of the just men of Jewish scripture such as Moses, God’s servant,5 or Joshua, who pushed the Israelites to await rest on the Sabbath,6 or Aaron, who offered sacrifices on behalf of the Israelites at God’s command,7 or Abraham, who patiently awaited fulfillment of his covenant with God,8 or King Melchizedek, a priest not of the Levitical order but “through the power of an indestructible life,”9 the author presents ideals which are praised by Judaism and fulfilled by Christ. He follows these introductions with either an explanation or implicit connection as to how their roles are fulfilled by Jesus. For example, he prefaces the superiority of Jesus using the familiar framework of the superiority of Melchizedek as a high priest, saying: “accordingly Jesus has also become the guarantee of a better covenant ... but he holds his priesthood permanently, because he continues forever.”10 Referencing a handful of revered characters of the Old Testament, and outlining how Jesus exceeds their virtuous characteristics, the author rhetorically steelmans Judaism to emphasize the superiority of Christianity because of Christ’s ministry and passion.

After establishing Jesus as the fulfillment of several notable figures in the Old Testament, the author uses this foundation to reiterate the significance of Jesus’ death and resurrection as the new covenant. The author describes these figures, covenants, and rites as “shadows” of the reality to come under Christ.11 Whereas the high priests of the Jewish Temple offered repeated sacrifices on behalf of the Jewish population, the author of Hebrews underscores that Jesus’ crucifixion, bearing the sins of the whole world, is the fullest extent of sacrifice. Furthermore, his singular passion is the fulfillment of sacrificial atonement, erasing all transgressions made under the first covenant –the Jewish Law– and abolishing the necessity of further Jewish sacrifices.12,13 The author draws attention to the fact that previous covenants made between God and the Israelites were flawed by human and material inadequacy,14 however Jesus, the Son of God, is free from burdensome human flaws. Therefore, his passion and resurrection sealed the final covenant between God and man. In emphasizing the gravity of Jesus’ passion, the speaker begins to transition into the appropriate response from mankind, especially those who are already members of the church.

Old Testament imagery bleeds through this section as the author explains the severity of abandoning Christianity after benefiting from Jesus’ sacrifice. Throughout the sermon, but especially in the final chapters, the author stresses the necessity of maintaining the Christian faith in the face of tribulation. He implores his audience to be empowered by Jesus’ passion and the words of the Holy Spirit, saying “let us approach with a true heart in full assurance of faith.”15 Following this comparatively positive exhortation, the author warns against refusing Christ’s ultimate sacrifice, invoking images of fiery fury16 and the consequences of refusing God’s invitation to eternal salvation.17 Once again relying on Old Testament figures to serve as the backbone of his Christian model, the author anaphorically stresses the importance of patient endurance, recounting the righteousness of Old Testament paragons. He describes how, “By faith,” each of them was made right before God even in their trials.18 His message is clear, God rewards those who remain steadfast in their conviction of his plan for their salvation.

On top of the foundation presented through the Old Testament, The Letter to the Hebrews exposits the superiority of Christianity and the necessity of maintaining faith, even through persecution.

Justification - to be made right before God

Torah - A Hebrew word meaning “guidance,” “direction,” or more woodenly, “law.” It is often used as a technical term for the Law of God given to Moses or for the first five books of the Hebrew Scriptures, which were sometimes ascribed to Moses: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.

Tradition - Any doctrine, idea, practice, or custom that has been handed down from one person to another.

Trajan - Roman emperor from 98 - 117 C.E., known, in part, through his correspondence with Pliny the Younger.

Two Ways - The doctrine found in the Didache and the Epistle of Barnabas that people must choose between two ways of living, the way of life (light) and the way of death (darkness).

Undisputed Pauline Epistles - Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Philippians, 1 Thessalonians, and Philemon. Scholars are mostly unified in judging that these letters were actually written by Paul. See Deutero-Pauline Epistles and Pastoral Epistles.

Valentinus - Second-century Gnostic Christian who traced his intellectual lineage through his teacher Theudas back to the apostle Paul.

Valentinians - A group of second and third century Gnostics who followed the teachings of Valentinus with a set of myths comparable to those of the Sethians, but more closely aligned with the proto-orthodox Christians, in whose churches they worshipped and from whom it was difficult to distinguish them. See also Gnosticism; Sethians; Valentinus.

Vicarious Suffering - The notion that one person’s suffering occurs in the place or for the sake of another.

“We” Passages - Term used to describe a set of four passages in the book of Acts in which the author stops speaking in the third person about what paul and his companions (“they”) were doing, and speaks instead in the first person about what “we” were doing. Some scholars take these passages as evidence that the author of Luke and Acts was a companion of Paul; others believe that in theses passages the author of Acts has utilized a travel narrative as a source (much as he utilized other sources such as Mark and Q for his Gospel).

Zealots - A group of Galilean Jews who fled to Jerusalem during the uprising against Rome in 66-70 C.E., who overthrew the reigning aristocracy in the city and urged violent resistance to the bitter end. See also Fourth Philosophy.

Summaries
Chapter 1 - Early Christians and Their Literature
Canon - A set of writings deemed authoritative by a religious body
From the Greek word meaning “ruler” / “measuring rod”
The New Testament canon took ~300 years to develop; Before then Christianity was a disarray of beliefs
Largely controlled by the proto-orthodox Christians
Apostles - Jesus’ immediate followers
Torah - First five books of the Hebrew Bible → regarded as Law
Ebionites - Believed that Jesus was a righteous follower of the Torah who was “adopted” by God after his Baptism
AKA - Adoptionists
Arch-heretic - Someone who proliferates anti-Christian ideas
E.g., Paul, according to some early Christians
Marcionites - Followers of the 2nd century evangelist, scholar, and teacher: Marcion
Believed Paul’s writings → Jewish Law had no place anymore
Believed in two separate Gods: Jewish (old/cruel) and Christian (new/merciful)
Believed Jesus was not the son of the Jewish God, and was therefore not human (entirely spirit, no flesh)
Established the first “canon” which consisted of Pauline epistles & Luke’s Gospel
Gnostics - Claimed that special gnosis (knowledge) was necessary for salvation
From Greek gnosia meaning “knowledge”
Large and diverse group that believed in 30-365 “gods”
Maintained that the Evil, Old God created the material world, which Jesus (the embodiment of the New God) came to deliver them from via knowledge
Knowledge was secret and for elect members, only derivable from the “hidden” meaning of Apostolic writings
Therefore, Meaning > literal understanding
Included Gospels of Mary, Philip, Judas, and Truth in their canon
Proto-orthodox Christians - Rose to power in the 4th century, allowing them to stifle the other 'heretical' sects of Christianity and establish the modern canon
Heresy - Greek for “choose”
Orthodoxy - Greek for “True belief”
Believed that Jesus was completely human, and wholly divine (unlike the Jews who thought he was entirely human, and not divine)
Believed that he taught the way to salvation, but was a single being, and was not exclusive in his ministry (unlike the gnostics)
Believed that the literal meaning of the text was all that was necessary
Balanced the contradictory human/divine narratives (Mark/John) by accepting both as true
2nd - 4th century: argued about what criteria necessitated canonicity:
Ancient vs. post-apostolic
Written by apostles → debate over identity of “Paul”
Catholicity/Widely Accepted → debate over Revelation and other Gnostic texts
Orthodoxy - does it espouse it the right belief
367 C.E. - First modern canon amerges ~250 years after the last book of the New Testament was written
Compiled by Athanasius - bishop of Alexandria, Egypt
Written to refute Marcion’s Canon
The New Testament Canon - Consists of 27 books written by 15-16 authors between 50-120 C.E.
Gospels - “good news”, the first four books of the New Testament
Matthew and John were apostles and authors
Mark was written by Peter’s secretary
Luke was written by Paul’s traveling companion
During the 2nd century, the authors were anonymous. Therefore, these authorial attributions are highly uncertain
Acts of the Apostles - Written by the author of Luke, about the spread of Christianity after Jesus’ death via Paul’s missionary evangelism
Epistles - The next 21 books which were letters written by Church leaders to the various communities, although some, like Hebrews, are more like written sermons than letters
13 of them believed to be written by “Paul”, though the historical authorship of several of them are highly contested
Only 7 of them are undisputedly attributed to Paul
They generally focus on the practice and interpretation of the Gospel
Revelation - The first surviving instance of Christian Apocalypse
Written by the prophet John about the culmination of Christianity
Apostolic Fathers - Early 2nd century authors whose writings were considered authoritative by the roto-orthodoxy
Manuscripts - Produced by the Apostolic Fathers, considered tantamount to the Gospels or Paul’s writings
Nag Hammadi - Discovered in Egypt, 1945 -- 15 fragments of books found in a jar.
Contained 52 treatises written in Coptic
Contained several 2nd Century epistles, apocalypses, teaching, & Gospels
Suppressed from the Canon by the proto-orthodoxy
Christology - The study of the identity of Christ
Docetism - Belief the Jesus was all spirit and only appeared to be human
Promulgated by Marcion and his followers
Repudiated by Tertullian of Carthage → writing to establish that Christ was born fo the virgini Mary, had flesh, was crucified, died, rose again, and was a single divine/human person
Mark - Contains no birth narrative, starts with the Baptism → mission → Christ is very human
Luke - Heavy focus on the nativity
Matthew - Shares Luke’s focus on the nativity
John - Jesus is pre-existent, logos → GOD
Chapter 3 - The Traditions of Jesus in Their Greco-Roman Context
Greco-Roman Religions - Polytheistic, stressed importance of sacrifice, lack of importance of what people believed/practiced
Had no explicit societal structure/institution/leaders
Had no doctrinal statements or ethical commitments
Had no sacred written authorities (Quran, Old Testament)
Had no beliefs in afterlife which modern religions are oriented around
Had no separation of Church and state
Shared a basic tolerance within the bounds of polytheism
Local deities were responsible for specific aspects of daily life correlated to similarly localized cults of worship
Hierarchy of Greco-Roman figures
Zeus/Jupiter
Rest of the “Big 12”
Tertiary gods (dionysus - wine, Priapus - masculinity)
Local deities
Divine humans, demigods, heroes (hercules)
Humans (men > women/slaves)
Daimonia - “Demon” without the negative connotation
Penates / Lenates - pantry/food & household protectorates who were represented in household shrines
Religion was oriented around preserving the current life rather than securing an afterlife (sparing themselves from Nether / Hades)
Cults / Cultus Deorum - “care of the gods” → attributed healing, agricultural and military success, wealth, prosperity, etc. to gods which was achievable through prayer and sacrifice
Gave rise to the Imperial Cult of compulsory worship of state gods for the benefit of Rome
Extispicy - Method of reading sacrificial animal entrails to determine the efficacy of a sacrifice in the eyes of the gods
Practiced by designated priest known as a Haruspex
Augurs - Roman priests who would divine the will of the gods via various methods such as reading bird flights/entrails
Oracles - Personal divination through the use of an entranced priestess
Octavian - Ended the civil wars following Julius Caesar’s murder after he attempted to become dictator in 44 B.C.E.
Octavian assumed full control in 27 B.C.E → Caesar Augustus
Came to be revered as a god-emperor in some parts of Roman culture (Asia Minor)
Magic - Recognized to be a viable (albeit fringe / taboo) alternative to religion when sacrifices were unfruitful
Mystery Cults - Sanctioned forms of secret cults who worshipped a specific god or figure exclusively
Isis, Mithras, Demeter/Persephone, Dionysus
Associated with resurrection
Philosophy - Stoics, Platonists, Epicureans
Focused on being successful or happy in the harsh world
Much more concerned with doctrine (how to think) and ethics (how to live) than G-R religions
Highly competitive/mercantile in their ‘conversion’
Chapter 4 - The Christian Gospels: A Literary and Historical Introduction to Oral Tradition
Critical Dates: The canonical Gospels were all written in a 35-60 year range
30 year gap between Jesus' death and the first written accounts of his life
In that 30 year gap, various forms of Christianity spread like wildfire
Jesus left behind 11 men and several women who spread word of his ministry, passion, and resurrection
By 325 C.E., the whole Mediterranean and most of Asia Minor had a notable Christian population
People believed that Jesus was going around saving people, strongly aiding conversion efforts
These stories about Jesus going around healing people after his death, being told by thousands were not historically true whatsoever
Historical reliability and the phenomena of Oral Tradition
Kernels of historical truth embedded in Oral Traditions have shifted over time to fit the needs of evolving situations
2nd century proto-orthodox Christians attributed authorship of the Gospels of to early, important figures to lend their stories credibility
However, none of the Gospels make authorial claims excluding perhaps Luke
The majority of the apostles were uneducated, Jewish fishermen and tax collectors, who were likely not-bilingual or literate in Greek
They could have been sources for authors of the Gospels though, through Oral Tradition
The author of Luke states that the accounts have been passed down from eye witnesses → not very reliable necessarily
Ancient writers were concerned with demonstrating cosmic truth rather than historical truth
The gospels function as fables which provide a larger truth than what the actual text says
Criteria for historical reliability:
Should not contradict itself,
Should be generally plausible,
Should be externally verified, preferably outside of its own [Gospel] genre
All of the Gospels were written by Jews, and therefore the texts are heavily influenced by Jewish traditions, motifs, and most importantly the Jewish Law
Passover - The commemoration of the freeing of the 1st born sons of the Israelites via sacrificing of a lamb, sprinkling its blood on the doorpost, and eating a fast meal in preparation for the Exodus
Judaism somewhat resembled a cultic devotion similar to other Greco-Roman polytheisms in that they would worship/sacrifice to a god (in adherence to the Abrahamic Law) to improve their present life and satisfy the communal/household needs
Believed in immortal beings in between them and God similar to Greco-Roman Daimonia : Cherubim, Seraphim, Angels/archangels
Believed that God was known and knowable, but powerful and cultishly worshipped in Judea → “Jews” until military crisis saw the Jews driven out of Judea by Babylonians to Babylon, Egypt, etc., where they retained their religious practices until 600 B.C. → Diaspora = dispersion
Still worshipped the 1 God of Israel, not a local deity, and exclusively of Israel via Abrahamic Covenant
Fewer Jews in Palestine around Jesus’ life than after the Diaspora: ~7% Roman population
Torah = Guidance, direction → Jewish Law, was viewed as God’s greatest gift to his people, not burdensome
Ancient Jews were committed to the Law because they had already been showed favor as God’s chosen people → the Law was their means of thanking God
Pentateuch - “The 5 scrolls”
Septuagint - Post-diaspora Greek translation of the Torah that was most widely used
LXX - Meaning “Made by 70” or 72 Jewish translators
Most of the Jewish practices were considered normal for Greco-Roman religions, excluding circumcision and the Sabbath
Nonetheless, Judaism was respected for its antiquity: Romans loved old cultures, religions, etc. (See Roman religion as a copy/paste of Greek religion)
The Temple of Jerusalem - The central place of sacrifice and worship according to the Torah
500 yards x 325 yards, no mortar, 100 ft. walls; a tremendous engineering feat
After the first Temple built under Solomon was destroyed, the second Temple's construction began in 538 B.C.E, and was finished in 63 C.E.
Destroyed ~7 years later as retribution for the Jewish rebellion
Meant to be the only/final temple to the God of Israel due to the presence of the Holy of Holies within → God’s dwelling place
On the Day of Atonement, Yom Kippur, High priest performed a sacrifice for all the sins of the people
Temple segregated to various inner-sections depending on importance/association
Accounted for by the Jew tax to build the hugely expensive Temple by allowing for group sacrifices/worship gatherings → Synagogues
Distinct from Greco-Roman places of worship by their uniform, Jewish purpose and inclusion of women and children
Josephus - 1st century Jewish historian who “prophesied” Vespasian’s emperorship
Alexander the Great - Overthrew Persian empire who controlled Palestine ~300 B.C.
Antiochus Epiphanes - Syrian ruler of Palestine after Alexander who attempted cultural unification by requiring adoption of Greek culture
Hellenization - Forced cultural assimilation → illegal to circumcise babies, must adopt to Greek culture
Maccabeans - Descendants of Jewish priests of Judas Maccabeus
AKA Hasmoneans - Started revolts in 167 B.C.E. against their Syrian overlords
Ruled Palestine autonomously, after driving out Syrians, until 63 B.C.E. when Pompey conquered it
40 B.C. - Romans appointed King Herod to rule the Jews ruthlessly
Hisson Herod Antipas - Son of King Herod who ruled during Jesus’ life
4th main groups of Jews / ~4 million:
Pharisees - ~6,000 members
Essenes - ~4,000 members (according to Josephus)
Sadducees - Far fewer members than Pharisees or Essenes
Fourth Philosophy - sick blokes
Pharisees (law) - Best known, least understood
Label of hypocrite filtered down through later Christian texts
Focused on knowing & obeying God to the fullest extent
Appended oral tradition to the Laws of Moses to flesh it out
Specified what it meant to keep the Sabbath Holy → no work, travel, must tithe everything
Sadducees (priests) - No texts left from them
Political and religious elite (high priests, composed the Sanhedrin, aristocracy)
Usually cooperated with Rome
Promoted strict adherence to the Torah → only text they accepted, did not believe in an afterlife/Hell
Stressed proper ritual worship → sacrifice, pilgrimage
Essenes (ascetics) - Referenced , but not named in the New Testament
Only group not mentioned in the New Testament, but we also know the most about them because of the Dead Sea Scrolls
Believed the Jews in Jerusalem had gone astray → secluded themselves at Qumran
Developed a new community to practice Mosaic Law without the imposition of the Pharisees
Awaited the apocalypse (many Jews awaited in in their life)
Disdained marriage and other material distraction
Strict admission requiring the forfeiture of all possessions to the community (focus on equity for the communal good) followed by 1 year of brutal, minimalist "catechesis," brought closer into the community for 2 more years of testing
Pesher - Essenic method of symbolic interpretation of God's revelations to Habbakuk
Some of the Dead Sea Scrolls indicate that God’s kingdom would be ruled by two Messiahs → a king and a priest
4th Philosophy (militant) - According to Josephus
Believed they had the right to the land of Israel, given by God, to be defended by any means possible
Strongly disagreed with the Sadducees who favored Roman occupation of Judea
Members of the Sicari ("daggermen" → one of the earliest-known, organized assassin groups in history) took control of the Temple (67-70 C.E.), refusing to surrender to Rome → led to the destruction of the Temple/Jerusalem
Even some Greco-Roman pagans were monotheistic
Hanina Desa & Honi “The Circle Drawer” - Jesus’ miracle-working contemporaries
Chapter 5 - The Spread of Early Christianity
Even though the Gospels were written long after Jesus’ death, they preserve some authenticity via Oral Tradition
All were published anonymously at first
30 C.E. Jesus dies, 70 C.E. Gospel of Mark, 80-85 C.E. Matthew and Luke, 90-95 C.E. Gospel of John
15-20 loyal followers after his crucifixion spread “Christianity” throughout the Roman Empire such that it became a world religion by the time the Gospels were written at the end of the 1st Century
Converted not by sermons, but individually
No mention of Jesus or his followers in pagan literature
Stories likely told in Greek even though Jesus spoke Aramaic
Oral Traditions were changed whenever they were cited in order to be relevant to new situations
Focus on Moral/Cosmic Truth >> Historical Truth
The differences in the Gospels are significant, but each conveys some emphasis about Jesus
“Four Cardinal Directions” - Four winds → four gospels
St. Irenaeus offered the first reasoning for the four gospels using natural reasoning
Gnotha - “Disputed texts”/Bastard texts → Acts of the Apostles, The Gospel of Peter, Revelation
Chapter 6 - A brief Overview of Roman Literature
Genre - writings that share conventions and are therefore classified together
Form: poetry or prose, short or long, narrative or descriptive, etc.
Content: nature or society, philosophy or mystery, etc.
Function: inform, persuade, both?
Greco-Roman Biography - less concerned with factual data compared to impact, personality, behavior → fables
Based on Oral Tradition
Plutarch, Suetonius, Tacitus - Authors of Roman antiquity
Gospel genre put a huge focus on death of the protagonist → gives us the archetypal Christ-figure
Chapter 7 - The Gospel of Mark
The shortest and earliest surviving account of Jesus
Depicts Jesus as the misunderstood Messiah, sent by God to fulfill his mission on Earth
Begin’s with Jesus’ baptism by John the Baptist and ends with reports of his resurrection
Used by Matthew and Luke as a source
Starts the use of the term "Jesus Christ" = anointed one, meant nothing yet, so the original Greek simply stated that Jesus was the Messiah which was the equivalent
John the Baptist - Performing baptisms for the forgiveness of sins, dressed and ate like the Old Testament prophet Elijah
After Jesus' Baptism, the heavens split open and the Holy Spirit proclaims Jesus to be the Son of God
The Title “Son of God” was not unique to Jesus → Hanina and Honi also were called Sons of God
Jesus is then thrust into the wilderness to be tempted by the Devil
According to Mark, Jesus is supremely authoritative: when he speaks, people obey
Enters the Synagogues to teach and astonish with authority, not like the scribes
Commands unclean spirits as well to obey → Healer
Even with this authority, he is extremely misunderstood
Hated by religious leaders of his Jewish people
Observes Jewish tradition, law, practices → ultimately betrayed by Jews still
Jewish Scribes - Literate elite who studied Sacred Traditions of Israel
Herodians - Collaborators w/ Herod → Rome
Chief Priests - Upper-class Sadducees who offered sacrifices in the Temple
Jesus disobeys the elite teaching in order to help people
Eats with the unclean, “works” on the sabbath, etc.
Pharisees partner with their sworn enemies, the Herodians, and plan to have him killed for his egregious perversion of Jewish Law
Only God, Jesus, Demons, Mark, and the Reader understand that Jesus is the Son of God
“Do you not yet understand” - After feeding thousands
After healing the blind man in stages, the disciples gradually begin to recognize Jesus → Peter calls him “The Christ”
Jesus confirms, but says not to tell anyone about him → Messianic Secret
Passion - Greek for "suffering"
Peter calls Jesus “Christ” as in “Messiah” as in delivered of Israel, does not understand Jesus when he says he [Peter] will suffer and die
Messianic Secret - of Mark → Jesus’ numerous attempts to keep his name a secret → for fear of misinterpretation of “Messiah”
Jews anticipated a strong, powerful kingly figure who would militantly deliver them from their oppressors (Rome), Jesus did not resemble this image of a Messiah
“Get behind me Satan” → Reprimanding Peter's focus on human grandeur (in accordance with the Jewish understanding of Messiah) rather than divine purpose
His disciples continue to fail to understand → he tells them they will suffer too
Jesus predicts the destruction of the Temple, the Judgement of Man, and the Apocalypse are soon to come in their own generation
Mark’s Passion
Jesus is anointed
Last supper → prayer at Gethsemane → arrest → trial before the Sanhedrin → Peter denies Jesus 3 times → Jesus reveals his misunderstood identity as the Messiah → is charged with blasphemy → pilate charges him for treason, as he claims to be the Messiah → king of Israel ≠ Roman emperor
Mark depicts Jesus' own uncertainty in his prayer at Gethsemane, the abandonment of his followers and betrayal: “My god, my god, why have you forsaken me”
Temple curtain ripped down the middle, centurion acknowledges Jesus’ identity
No historical accounts match this, however
God is now free to all people according to Mark
On the day after the Sabbath, Mary Magdalene, Mary mother of James, and Salome go to the tomb, see a man dressed in white, and tell no one out of fear, even though he instructed them to tell the followers to meet Jesus at Galilee
Book ends → but later, scholars appended 12 more verses to smooth out the end
Mark was not Jewish → gets some Jewish traditions wrong → but does it to stress the Jewishness of Jesus to demonstrate that ALL peoples are saved → written when the Temple was destroyed → misunderstood the reason for the destruction
Chapter 8 - The Synoptic Problem
Redaction Criticism - The study of how a text has been modified over time
Synoptic Problem - How to explain why there are differences, but also verbatim agreements between Matthew, Mark, and Luke (The Synoptics)
Four Source Hypothesis - Mark (Markan Priority) was written first, and used as a source by Matthew and Luke
Matthew and Luke also used another shared source, Q → from “Quelle” German for source
Q explains things not found in Mark, but does not include a passion narrative, just a collection of sayings of Jesus
The Synoptics can be "seen together" → syn -optic
Mark	Q
↓	↓
M →	Matthew	Luke	← L
Beatitudes - Delivered at the Sermon on the Mount
The incontinences wrapped around Mark’s stories in Matthew and Luke show that Mark was a source
Matthew condensed Markan miracles in to a single Chapter (8), and Luke follows Q more closely
Parenthetical material - “(let the reader understand … )”
Found in Mark, even though his audience is < 10% literate, the same parenthetical material is used in Matthew
Luke’s preface 1:1 - 1:4 acknowledges that he’s using other sources: some eye witness, some Oral Tradition, and some written (Mark)
Triple Tradition - When all 3 Synoptics use the same words
Augustan Hypothesis - Matthew wrote first, and was used by Mark, who was used by Luke
Griesbach - Matthew wrote first, used by Luke, both of which were used by Mark
Holtzmann/Streeter - Mark wrote first and was independently used by Matthew and Luke
Farrer Hypothesis - Mark wrote first and was used by both → Scholars accept this the most
Evidence of a Markan Priority
Shortness, bad grammar, challenging/difficult readings
Lack of Matthew-Luke agreements against Mark
Redactional emphasis (87% of Mark is in Matthew, 70% of Mark is in Luke)
If Mark was written last, its author forced an abridged gospel which omits so much of what is contained in Matthew and Luke
Even though Mark is the shortest, he tells the longest stories
Mark is not a good “summation,” whereas Luke is written like an Ancient History comprising all the cosmic truths of the story
Much of Mark appears in Matthew and Luke, but not both - so to say it was used to verify truth by 2 witnesses is not an argument
Mark used bad Aramaic, slang, redundant sentences, poor grammar, and Greek words he doesn’t seem to understand, many of which are corrected in Matthew and Luke
His Aramaic expressions are deleted by the other 2 Synoptic authors - unlikely that Mark wrote later and added them “for fun”
Theologically challenging passages from Mark are modified
6:5 “He could not do any mighty works, because there was no faith” → “He would not do any mighty works, because there was no faith”
“Why do you call me good?” → “Why do you ask me what is good”
“Why have you forsaken me” → Into your hands I commend my spirit”
“Looked around in anger” → “Looked around”
Lack of Matthew and Luke going against Mark
Lots of Mark + Matt ≠ Luke
Lots of Mark + Luke ≠ Matt
Not a lot of Matt + Luke ≠ Mark because they both have to get the same thing wrong in the same way to contradict Mark, but were written independently of one another
When Either Matthew or Luke diverge from Mark, they have a very specific theological purpose for doing so
E.g. “Son of David” → Matthew highly emphasizes the genealogical Messiah
Fulfillment Motif - 10+ instances of “x was done in order to fulfill the scriptures/prophecies” in Matthew
Mark and Luke still link to scripture via “it was written”, but not to the same obsessive extent as Matthew’s New Moses
Done in order to establish Jesus’ authority as the Law
Evidence for Quelle - German for “Source”
Source for Matthew and Luke’s verbatim agreements
Order of the Q material (weak, but arguable)
Arguments for a Lukan priority are non-existent; Mattan priority is the only alternative, but it just doesn’t make sense
Q was likely a written source
Verbatim agreements in Matt and Luke = Double Tradition
Order of Q - Lots of disagreements in order, but when they share word for word Q, the order is preserved
Doublets - Usage of the same text twice in one Gospel → half verbatim from Mark, half verbatim from Matt and Luke (Q) → implies the authors of Matthew and Luke had access to both sources
Chapter 9 - The Gospel of Matthew: The Jewish Messiah
"First" Gospel, widely treasured, shares 2/3rds of Mark
Author was likely a Greek outside of Palestine writing in 80-85 C.E.
Establishes Jesus as theNew Moses, the Last Prophet
Stresses that Jesus is a man of Israel -- Matt’s Genealogy of 14
Jesus is here to fulfill the Law’s intent → still very much invested in Jewishness
Fulfillment citations - 11 Total, “This was done so that x was fulfilled”
Jesus very neatly fits into Jewish history
Jesus' message is not new, just a continuation of Judaism → the Final Prophet
Matthew removes all of Mark’s Aramaic words and writes in Greek, but his audience is still Jews and Gentiles
Jesus the New Moses - Flees to Egypt to escape the slaughter of innocents → receives/interprets the law on top of a mountain → … → directly parallels OT Exodus
The Great Commission and Matthew’s Gentile Mission
“Go and make disciples of all nations and peoples” at the end of the book which opens up the mission to gentiles
Unlike in Mark, everyone but Jewish leaders (and the 3 pagan Magi) recognize Jesus as the Messiah → perhaps to stress guilt?
Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount - Jesus’ fulfillment of Jewish Law
Beatitudes - Descriptions of those who are blessed
Antitheses - Jesus’ new interpretations of Mosaic Law → The purpose is not the detail, but the root meaning
Golden Rule - Do unto others as you would have them due unto you
Matthew offers a different interpretation of the Law than the popular, strict interp. → usually more strict, but also simpler than the Pharisees would want
E.g 5:27 “Don’t commit adultery” → “Don’t have lust in your heart at all”
Extrapolates the scope of the law from act to intent
Matthew’s message: If you understand the very core of the law, then you will obey it. Jesus is saying be better than the Pharisee’s
Says the first 2 commandments inform the rest of the law
Chapter 10 - The Gospel of Luke: Exegesis of Good & Evil
Believed to have been written by Luke’s traveling companion who also wrote Acts
Written 80-85 C.E.
Luke constructs Christianity directly in opposition to Satan/Demons
Depicts Jesus as a prophet, like from the Old Testament, to explain how Christianity spread from Jews to Gentiles too
Four Verse preface is a standard Greek Historiographic Prologue
Suggests that the topic was well researched and far superior to any previous sources, and the author identifies himself
Makes an implicit, negative evaluation of Mark
Says he is writing for “The most excellent Theophilus” → Lover of God, or perhaps a Roman governor in order to explain what Christianity is (not a threat to the state) → informed defense = an Apology
As a two-set volume with Acts, Luke traces the miraculous birth of Christ and his ascent followed by the spread of the Church
Birth narrative is similar, but different from Matthew
Joseph and Mary go to Bethlehem for Caesar Augustus’s census in Luke, they return home to Nazareth right away, not time for a flight to Egypt or the 3 magi
In both Gospels, Jesus is born in Bethlehem, and raised in Nazareth, but for different reasons (Temple infancy narrative in Luke vs. Old Testament parallels in Matthew)
Jesus resembles a demigod figure, the pagan audience would understand his messiahship
Luke has a Dualistic Cosmology : The Kingdom of God vs. the Material World
Present theme in Mark and Matthew as well, but Luke stresses it more
Jesus sends out 70-72 disciples to preach and “Satan fell from the heavens like a flash [gradually though] of Lightning”
Jesus defeats Satan in the wilderness, comes back, and begins to exorcise demons who ask “Have you come to destroy us?”
He expels demons with The Finger of God -- From Exodus and only used by Moses and Aaron → Jesus is tantamount with Old testament Badasses
Jesus doesn’t answer the demons, but Luke makes it clear that they’re afraid of him
Everything bad in Luke is attributed to Satan → very Greco-Roman
Sick? blind ? ill? → probably the work of SATAN
Luke repeats the practice of freeing people from bondage
Very apocalyptic, but far less urgent than the other synoptics
Luke’s Two-Part Eschatology - “End of the World”
Kingdom of God is already here → Jesus combating Satan’s materialism
Kingdom of God will come fully later ... not tomorrow though, as Mark thought → the Mission must be spread first
Exegesis of Luke Chapter 11:14-23
Satan is the Strong man and his property is the Material World
Jesus is the Stronger man who strips satan of the fallacies and sin gave him dominion of the world
Jesus is the stronger man, who frees people from bondage and ushers in the Kingdom of God
Jesus’ birth is announced to Zechariah in the Temple, Jesus is born and consecrated in the temple, recognized as the Messiah by Simeon and the old Jewish priestess Anna
Jesus spends CH 9 - CH 19 traveling back to Jerusalem to be betrayed, much larger portion than the other gospels → significant
Luke also traces genealogy, but does so differently than Matthew, but both do so in order to show that Jesus is the Son of God
Luke’s gospel begins and ends in the Temple
Explicitly claims to be an anointed prophet of God at the start of his public ministry
Jesus’ death is totally in control: “Father into your hands I commend my spirit”
Less atonement like Mark and John where Jesus is the sacrificial Lamb of God
“Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me” → concerned for others, but confident in himself
Asks for forgiveness for those who are killing him
“Today you will be with me in paradise”
Luke stresses that Jesus was innocent → Centurion Longinus recognizes “Truly this man was innocent” → Archetype of a Martyr setting the stage for Acts
Jesus bloody sweat was later added to corroborate Mark’s depiction of Jesus’ agitation
For Luke, salvation is not brought about through Jesus’ death, but through the subsequent repentance for the miscarriage of justice
Author of Luke, Paul’s traveling companion wrote Acts too
Describes the Temple heavily, God’s message comes through it, but the Jews reject it → reject Jesus
Chapter 19 - Luke Volume 2: Electric Boogaloo - Acts of the Apostles
Highly contested source for the reconstruction of Early Church History
According to ancient genres, Acts is written as a historical story → many of the speeches were probably made up
Not to recount “what actually happened,” but the cosmic truth
Similar in style to Thucydides - account of the Greek Peloponnesian war, or Livy’s Ab Urbe Condita, or Josephus’ Antiquities of the Jews
Limited objectivity due to the scope and importance of Oral Tradition which informed the stories → speeches were never part of primary Oral Tradition → always retconned to fit the occasion/character
¼ of Acts is speeches delivered Paul and the Apostles
Nonethless, it is the earliest source of anything in the New Testament
Dated around 90-95 C.E.
Written by ‘Luke’
Paul and Luke
Paul - highly educated Roman citizen, claimed to start the gentile mission
180 C.E. Irenaeus asserts that Acts is written by Luke, a physician who was the traveling companion of Paul
Follows Luke’s unitary vision/recapitulation of the spread of Christianity
Historical reliability of Luke/Acts can be cross examined by Paul’s letters
3 Things that Must Be True for Irenaeus's assertion to stand
Author was a constant companion of Paul
Luke and Paul must tell the same story (they don’t)
“We” Passages must be literal pronoun references, not stylistic choices
1. Luke’s mentions in Paul’s letters
Mentioned: Philemon 1:23-24, Colossians 4:14, and 2 Timothy 4:11
Only one of those is definitely written to/by/about Paul
2. Do they tell the same story?
Paul in Acts, According to Luke	Paul in his own Epistles
Paul’s miracles precipitate belief, as good/better than Peter → necessary to establish his authority as a former persecutor	No mention of miracle working, but claims he started the gentile movement
Gives many speeches, even argues with philosophers in the Areopagus	Admits that he’s not a good public speaker
Is on friendly terms with the disciples	Seems to have arguments with the disciples
Paul is run out of Damascus by the Jews	Paul was chased out by the governor
Paul is not one of the disciples, Luke writes to try to reconcile the two factions: Peter and the disciples v. Paul’s following
3. The “We” Passages
Acts 16:9-17, 20:4-15, 27:1-28
Passages are indicative of an eye witness → Luke?
Stylistic choice/device?
Changes of tone, vocab, structure, skill, etc. are things that indicate a change in author → but that doesn’t happen in the “we” passages, it’s just “we”
If Luke was an eyewitness, why not write the whole thing in the 1st person, probably bc he wasn’t there
Famous essay that in ancient times, Nautical Passages are written in the 1st person
Ehrman says it’s an intentional device to invite the reader to think that the whole text is 1st person, and therefore more credible, but w/o having to claim presence of 1st person in the whole text
Verdict: inclusion of a “we” source
Things Luke Gets right
Luke’s topography is accurate according to the other Gospel accounts
Social setting - he knows about/has sources that know about the specific/important cities like “Artemis of the Ephesians”
Can name Roman officials/hierarchies
Historical events like the “worldwide” famine
Things Luke gets wrong
Holy family having to travel to their hometown for the census → where they have no property/taxes??
Just says so in order to fulfill scripture
Herod dies in 4 B.C.E. → not possible for the holy family to be in a census under the reign of herod
Next confirmed census was in 6 A.D.
Luke is telling the story that is important for the Early Christian Church, not the one that’s historically accurate necessarily
Luke’s Jews reject prophets according to Luke, so Acts is the spread of the message to the gentiles
Acts is a huge unitary claim to reconcile the idea of a Pauline/Peterine faction → NO there is ONE church, led by Peter, Paul and the Holy Spirit. Luke writes it into existence
The Gospel of Luke was a Greco-Roman Biography about Jesus, the prophet, but Acts has no central character → more historical and canonical
General History Genre - Traces people and key events to present
Thematic Criticism - Understanding Acts through the parallels from Luke
Acts is also dedicated to Theophilus -- which ties the authorship to Luke
Pentecost - Just as Jesus was rejected in his city, Jerusalem, as a prophet, so too will the apostles be rejected. Therefore, go out
Continued focus on on the Gentile Mission → “To the ends of the Earth”
Paul - The central character and the most notable convert of Acts
Former anti-Christian who is chased out of Damascus by the governor, becomes a church leader, converts several major cities, is arrested by Jewish leaders, put on trial, and ultimately put on house arrest in Rome
Continued presence of “two men in white robes” from resurrection accounts
Named at the Transfiguration as Moses (Law), and Elijah (Prophet)
Pushes more fulfillment narratives
Parallel presence of the Holy Spirit who enables miracles and is present at the Baptism and Pentecost
Jesus is executed as a martyr, and so are many of his followers
Whereas in Luke: Jesus is Jewish, sent from Jewish God, and follows Jewish Law, Acts is about being a Gentile Christian
Acts is Luke’s “necessary delay” of the Apocalypse so that the church can grow
Acts is largely composed of Apologies - speeches of Christians to legal/religious authorities
Main instigators of conflict in Acts are Jews
According to the Jews, those who view Jesus as the Messiah have lost touch with their roots in clear violation of scripture
Peter cites a pair of psalms which predict the need to replace Judas as a member of the 12 → implies that this era of Christianity found lots of old scripture being fulfilled in their midst, even though it’s not at all clear how it's happening...
1st Theme - God is behind the Christian movement → Jesus is the fulfillment
Peter’s first speech is about how the 12th has to have been a witness to Jesus’ resurrection and all the way back to his baptism, but literally none of the remaining, original 11 fit that description...
Peter implies that it is absolutely crucial to the propagation of the spread of Christianity → select Matthias → never mentioned again, crucial who?
2nd Theme - Christianity as a continuation of Christ as a continuation of Judaism
Speeches at the Council of Jerusalem regarding whether or not to circumcise gentiles → Decide that Jesus/God said that all are saved on equal grounds → Church leaders send a unified message to the Gentiles
Luke writes Acts as a history establishing how Christianity is not, in fact, the fragmentary mess that is was after Jesus died, but in fact a uniform religion that shares common beliefs
According to Luke, the Christians are in agreement on every major issue
Pentecostal speech from Peter -- Everything that happened is a fulfillment of scripture -- cites Joel
Blames the audience for Jesus’ death → saved by his resurrection, they can repent and be baptized
Jesus death does not bring atonement, but opportunity
Paul’s mission ends in Jerusalem, like Jesus’ → 7 more chapters about his trials and his innocence which is not recognized by any of the authorities he is brought before
During which he is portrayed as very Jewish (like Jesus) still found guilty
Used to show that his beliefs do not compromise Jewish faith
Luke’s Jesus is the ideal martyr whose death is continued/paralleled by his Apostles in Acts
Jesus was crucified under Tiberius
Jesus as a fulfillment of ancient sacred scriptures established its legitimacy which was otherwise pretty limited
Chapter 11 - The Gospel of John: Jesus, the Man sent from Heaven
“All things came into being through him” -- prologue
Acc. to Plato there’s a distinction between “being” and “coming into being”
Coming into being implies a beginning/time when it didn’t exist
Jesus does not come into being, he always was, with God → pre-existent
Jesus is very otherworldly and divine in John → “from above”
John’s Defining Features
Poetic literary style, philosophical, “high” literary style, excellent flowing Greek
Miracles are more spectacular than in the synoptics → seven Signs
Less action and more discourse e.g. CH 13-19 is a single speech
Indirect authorial claim? Introduces a possible perspective shift from the Synoptics → “Beloved Disciple caused these things to be written”
The Beloved Disciple - A member of Jesus’ inner circle, never explicitly name → believed to be John, Son of Zebedee
Jesus entrusts his mother to him, and he outruns Peter to Jesus’ tomb
Nitty Gritty Chop-Suey
Aporias - literary seams, interruptions, shifts in the text which indicate a change in author/source
CH 20: reads like an ending to the Gospel/source
CH 21: geographical, temporal and contextual shifts → picks up with a song of Zebedee and keeps going
Changes in Jesus’ style of teaching, the chronological framework, the characteristics of his miracles, and his opponents
In CH 2: Jesus flips the tables in the temple, and from then on “the Jews” in general, not just the leadership, are plotting to kill him for the rest of the Gospel
Very open about his identity, unlike Mark
His 3 year ministry ends in CH 12, then he retreats to a more private ministry w/lengthy speeches → timeline slows significantly after his “retirement” in direct contrast to the flow of Mark which instead accelerates
In the synoptics, Jesus teaches by parable, in John, he teaches by lengthy philosophical, abstract speeches
His eschatology is much more ambiguous than the synoptics which had more immediate apocalypses
Salvation rooted in believing in Jesus as the Son of God and communion with God, but not necessarily the Kingdom of God
A physical change must occur too: “You will become like the wind”
Jesus says you must be born “anothen” → both : from above/higher, and anew/again → very clever Greek
Jesus is the only one who explicitly espouses eternal life
Do not conflate eternal life with the Kingdom of God which was thought of as a legitimate divine, but physical territory (to be delivered by the Messiah)
Jesus waits 3-4 days to resurrect Lazarus to show that he can recombine body with soul which was unheard of in Greco-Roman literature outside of necromancy which was heavily frowned upon and was only a temporary “trick”
Different from the synoptics where Jesus is not a trick-pony
Jesus is more than willing to perform public signs in order convince people of his divine origin
No transfiguration, Jesus is already the radiant post-Transfiguration character for the whole Gospel
No baptism, because why baptize God
Jesus’ opponents are all of Judaism, who were antagonizing the Johannine Community at the time of the Gospel of John’s publication
Only 9 instances of 2-3 word verbatim phrases → likely only shared Oral Tradition as a source, which is why it still shares Jesus’ biographical skeleton
John’s Sources - Authored the Gospel, and maybe 1, 2, 3 John, and Revelation to varying degrees of certainty
Similar styles and philosophies, so it’s either the same author, or a member of the Johannine Community
Signs source
Long discourses about symbolic themes source
Passion, death, and resurrection stories
The Johannine School
Originally a group of Palestinian Israelites
Jesus’ Samaritan Journey
Expulsion from the Synagogue → est. of Jesus’ high Christology and Jewish resentment, either the cause or the result of Expulsion, unclear
Johannine Christianity teaches that Jesus was flesh (John 6) which is how it was able to sneak into the Canon even with its comparatively unique Christology
Orthodoxy and Heresy
Orthodoxy - “right/straight” belief, everyone thinks they’re Orthodox
Heresy> - “Choice” → people who willfully choose the wrong belief → deemed heretical by historians if you lost the battle of relevance
Council of Nicea - 325 C.E. → called to address the diversity of the Early Church, produced the Nicene Creed
Constantine calls on the Church to unify → workout what’s heresy and what’s orthodoxy
How to get from diversity to standardization
Eusebius - Father of Church history: 10 volumes on Ecclesiastical History
Tried to trace the origins of the Church back to Jesus
First and Earliest comprehensive history of the Early Church
Probably less historically accurate → founded on Apostolic Succession → making everyone not in the succession a heretic
Walter/Bauer Model - German who rethinks our acceptance of Eusebian model
Instead chooses to geographically assess all of Christian history
The earliest recoverable belief they found in almost every place was heretical e.g. Egyptian gnostics and Syrian Marcionites → Not a united Christian faith as Luke/Eusebius would suggest
Wrote his thesis in 1800s, years before the Nag Hammadi which yielded several corroborating gnostic texts
Homoousios - Made of the same matter
Views on Jesus
Mark - Appears to become ‘Son of God’ after Baptism
John - Jesus is pre-existing God
Thomas - Jesus’ death is unimportant, his words reveal secrets though
Summary
Johannine Prologue (Chapter 1)
“The word was God,” “Without him not on thing came into being,” “In him was life”
Although not explicitly called the "Word" later on, Jesus’ sayings/actions parallel this Logos identity
“And dwelt among us” → Jesus’ humanity
Establishes the framework by which Jesus’ primarily refers to himself throughout the rest of the book → by strict relation to the Father, the one who sent him, the one who can judge
Transitions to John proclaiming the way of the the Lord: “Make straight the way of the Lord” (1:23)
Calls him the “Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!” “The son of God,” “Lamb of God”
Recruits Andrew and Peter, Philip
Nathaniel calls him: “Son of God, King of Israel”
Jesus responds: “Very truly, I tell you, you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.”
Wedding of Cana : 1st Sign
Jesus turns water into wine and references his hour/cup that is yet to come → “And revealed his glory, and his disciples believed him”
Drives out those dealing in the temple with a whip of cords → “Stop making my Father’s house a marketplace” → open revelation of identity
“Destroy this temple [his body], and I will rebuild it in three days”
His message is misunderstood, but many believed in him for his signs
Dialogue with Nicodemus
“Very truly, I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God without being born of water and Spirit.”
Repeatedly calls himself the “Son of Man” → confirms his heavenly origin
“For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life.”
More baptizing, John continues to refer to Jesus as heavenly and not worldly
Samaritan Woman at the well
Tells her about her several husbands → can read minds/hearts
Jesus claims to be the Messiah, the Christ, she rushes to bring the town to meet him, they believe him to be “Truly the savior of the World”
Jesus provides the water of eternal life
Jesus heals a royal official’s son who “believed the word” : 2nd Sign (4:46)
Jesus heals the sick man at the pool : 3rd Sign
Criticized for working on the sabbath, responds: “My Father is still working, and I also am working.” → Jews seek to kill him for blaspheme on top of the rest
Implies that he is the Son of God, and that his word grants eternal life (5:24) → Attributes all his power to the Father
“Not that I accept such human testimony, but I say these things so that you might be saved” → >> Human → His signs are so that they might believe
“ I do not accept glory from human beings.” → Refutes the Messianic archetype whilst claiming to be the Son of God
John 6 : 4th, 5th Sign
Large crowd follows him around the time on Passover
Multiplication of loves for 5,000 (4th) → they are about to try to make him king so he retreats across the sea towards Capernaum
Jesus walks on water : (5th)
The crowd follows
What must we do to perform the works of God?” Jesus answered them, “This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent.” → point of John’s gospel, you must believe
Jesus says “I am the bread of life,” “I am the bread that came down from heaven.” not figuratively → (6:54) → John’s institution of the Eucharist in absence of the Lord’s Supper
Disciples/Peter recognize him as “Holy One of God.”
The Adulterous Woman
“Let anyone among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.”
Rebuking the zeal of the Pharisees who seem to take pleasure in meticulously upholding the their interpretation of Mosaic law
“You are from below, I am from above; you are of this world, I am not of this world.” → More open revelation
Lengthy discourse with Pharisees in the Temple → arguing with them about being from the Devil, which is why they don’t understand what he is saying (8:40)
“Jesus answered, “If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, he of whom you say, ‘He is our God,’”
Ends with them trying to stone him
The Blind Man From Birth : 6th Sign
“Jesus answered, “Neither this man nor his parents sinned; he was born blind so that God’s works might be revealed in him. “ 9:3
Jews are very antagonistic at this point, the man’s parents refuse responsibility for confirmation that he was blind, bc admitting Jesus’ power would get them kicked from synagogue
Continues to argue with the pharisees and prophecies his own passion, likening himself to the passover lamb: “The one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep” → “The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.” (10:2-11)
With regard to his passion: “No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it up again.” → In control
Speaking to the crowds at festival asking about his messianic identity: “The Father and I are one.” → “The Jews took up stones again to stone him.” 11:31
Rhetorically asks if his works are from God, so then is he → They try to arrest him, but he escapes
Raising of Lazarus : 7th Sign
Mary and Martha summon Jesus to heal their brother, but Jesus says his end is for the glory of God and is for the glory of the Son of Man
Speaking to the disciples about having to go back into Bethany near Jerusalem , where he was nearly stoned in order to treat Lazarus, who had died, responds: “For your sake I am glad I was not there, so that you may believe.” → which is really fucked up
Countered by one of the few mentions of how Jesus felt in the whole collection of the Gospels: “When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her also weeping, he was greatly disturbed in spirit and deeply moved.”
“I am the resurrection and the life. Those who believe in me, even though they die, will live, and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?” (11:25) → Phrasing of ‘I am’, not 'I will' resurrect
Demonstration of prayer: “Father, I thank you for having heard me. I knew that you always hear me, but I have said this for the sake of the crowd standing here, so that they may believe that you sent me… Lazarus, Come out!” (11:41)
High priests find out, and begin to seriously plot his death, lest he continue to convert people
Jesus arrives in Bethany for the Passover
Enters Jerusalem to a great crowd of Jews who exalt him with palms
“Now my soul is troubled. And what should I say—'Father, save me from this hour'? No, it is for this reason that I have come to this hour.” → Direct attack at Mark’s Jesus
Father, glorify your name.” Then a voice came from heaven, “I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.” → literally speaking with God
The crowd argues about what it was, even though Jesus said the voice came for the express purpose that they might believe.
Still, many people, even leaders believe in Jesus, but are silent for fear of the Pharisees
Even though he has established that he has the authority to judge, as his Father has the authority to judge, he says: “for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.” (12:47)
Passover
Jesus washes the disciples feet to set an example of how they ought emulate his behavior towards each other
Jesus foretells the betrayal by Judas → Satan enters into him
“I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. If you know me, you will know my Father also.” (14:6)
“Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me;” Parallels the way that he said eat of my body so that I may abide in you and you in me
“ But the Advocate,a the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you everything, and remind you of all that I have said to you” → foreshadowing Pentecost
"I will no longer talk much with you, for the ruler of this world is coming." → continues to talk forever
"None of you asks where I am going" → right after they asked where he was going
Vine parable
Talks about how they will mourn and be in pain like a mother is in pain in childbirth, but then they will rejoice
Chapter 17: Prayer to God, now that he’s ready to go
“I am not asking on behalf of the world, but on behalf of those whom you gave me,” (18:9)
Judas betrays Jesus at the Kidron Valley with a detachment of soldiers
Jesus is angry with Peter for interrupting Jesus’ plan
Jesus does not hide the fact that he has been preaching in the Temple and synagogues → Annas brings him to the high priest Caiaphas who hands him over to Pilate to be killed
Peter denies Jesus three times
“Pilate asked him, ‘What is truth?’” but doesn’t wait for an answer
Pilate releases Barabbas to the crowd and has Jesus crucified
Jews don’t like the INRI inscription, but Pilate says it stays lol
Jesus entrusts Mary to the care of the “Beloved Disciple’s”
Why does Jesus say “It is finished” if he never institutes the last supper with the 3 cups????
“(He who saw this has testified so that you also may believe. His testimony is true, and he knows that he tells the truth.)” --beloved assumingly
Jesus’ body removed from the cross by Joseph of Arimathea
“The other disciple outran peter” to the empty tomb, what a twat
Mary sees two angels, turns and sees Jesus, but doesn’t recognize him
“Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book. 31 But these are written so that you may come to believe that Jesus is the Messiah,a the Son of God, and that through believing you may have life in his name.”
Jesus questions Peter’s love for him: “Feed my sheep”
Motifs present in John's Gospel
“The world hates … me because I testify against it that its works are evil.” 7:7
Repeatedly attributes all his powers/signs/teachings not to his own divine origin, but to “the one who has sent me”/”the father”
Bolsters his humanness
Rebukes them for not practicing the Law of Moses → “Why are you looking for an opportunity to kill me” → Open confrontation
Repeated commendation / promise of reward to those who believe: “Out of the believer’s heart shall flow rivers of living water.” (7:38 )
“I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness but will have the light of life.” (8:12)
Chapter 12 - From John’s Jesus to the Gnostic Christ
Gnosticism was highly derivative of Platonism
Preferred the Gospel of John, but there was not much gnosticism in the New Testament
Along with Marcionism, gnosticism was very popular and widely hated by proto-orthodox Church Leaders
Before the Nag Hammadi was discovered, we only knew what Church Leaders wrote about Gnosticism in condemnation
Gnosticism as a philosophy → Redeemer Myth - In the beginning was God, and all our souls were unified in him. Some accident caused the Gnostis fall from Pleroma, loss of memory, into oblivion. So now we are suck in materiality. From Pleroma, a redeemer, Christ, is sent who reveals the truth of our origin, allowing our spiritual ascent back to pleroma to abide in communion with God
Characteristics of Gnosticism
Metaphysical dualism → the spirit and matter are at odds with each other
Physical world was created by an inferior God of the Old Testament, which is why the material world is inferior
Brought about by cosmic disaster - the fall, evil God created all that is bad
God is unknowable → a pure spirit who is so great that we don’t/can't even know
Aeons - Personifications of God’s capacities
Also inhabit the divine realm with God as divine beings
Reason, Will, grace -- personifications of virtue
Last one, called Sophia, wisdom, who wanted to know the divine realm
She falls, as she is falling, creating other Aeons outside of the divine realm
Creates Ialdabaoth, creator of matter which is evil
Ialdabaoth divides Sophia throughout human bodies
Divine Spark - like the matrix, if you realize you’re trapped, you can be freed
Requires Gnosis → divine K N O W L E D G E
Divine Reader - Christ imbues salvific knowledge, but only for his Chosen Few → some people are just 0% spiritual, some can be saved through God’s work, and some with the Divine Spark
The Ascetics Ideal - Trying to cultivate the Divine Spark, they lived like monks
Reformed to a very diverse set of religions by the 2nd Century
Sethian Gnostics - understood themselves to be direct descendants of Seth of A/E
Lots of mythology surrounding his divine origin
Invisible Spirit - original, single, divine being, -evolved into an entire pleroma = “fullness” of other beings → the Aeons
Trinity of Barbelo - “Mother of All”, Christ/Son & the Invisible Spirit
Sophia births Sakla or Ialdabaoth - born outside of the divine realm → arrogant figure who believes himself to be God → OT God
Goal is to return the divine power in souls back to heaven
Valentinian Gnostics - followers of Valentinus 100 C.E. of Egypt
Much more merciful than the Sethian outlook
Humanity needs to set free various elements of the divine via gnosis from Christ
Johannine Epistles (AKA the Universal or Catholic Epistles) - written by a later author of the Johannine Community
After Jesus’ death, the community separated from the Church because they viewed Jesus as divine
1, 2, 3 John are all very short
The author of 2 John refers to himself as the “elder” in response to the “elect” lady, but then begins to address a larger group → probably a Christian leader advising a large group
John 3 was likely written by the same author due to the stylistic similarities
2 and 3 are authentic letters, John 1 is less authentic → it does not follow conventional structure of intro, greeting, prayer/thanksgiving -- instead it reads more like a persuasive essay
Probably the same author as 2 and 3 John, but is it the same author as the Gospel? Probably not because they were written later than John
Contextual Criticism - understanding the context out of which a text is born
Parallels with the Gospel of John
Light v. dark
New and Old Commandments
Love one another in the community
Being hated by the world
Sacrificial and sent from God
Abiding in Christ
1 John is a treatise to a community
2 John is a personal letter to a community
3 John is a personal letter to a member in the community
Contextual clues reveal that the community had secessionists who failed to recognize that Jesus was the Messiah → Antichrists
Ignatius - Author from the same period who also mentions antichrists
Opposed Docetics = thought Jesus only “appeared” or “seemed” to be the Christ
Christian communities had House Churches - much like how synagogues formed
Johannine community developed Jesus to be comparable to God, not just a prophet
Jesus is God → not flesh. Author of God is writing to these people who seceded and he thought they went to far
Makes several moral accusations against the secessionists
We don’t actually know what the secessionists thought/believed, can only infer from what the author is accusing them of → not reliable
John’s Community was not explicitly Gnostic - but they would have agreed with them on a lot of things
Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Tertullian, all saw Gnosticism as a major threat to unified Christianity
Criticized them on the grounds of orgies & eating babies
Secret meetings (mass) where these secessionists ate and drank together, kissed each other, and ate the flesh of the Son of [their] God
Early church fathers had access to text like the Nag Hammadi - but but misinterpreted them
Heracleon - Provided the first commentary on John around 170 C.E.
Chapter 13 - Jesus from Different Perspectives
Gospels of Thomas, Peter, and Judas were found in Nag Hammadi
Most non-canonical gospels were produced in the 2nd Century
4 main types: Narrative, Sayings, Infancy, and Passion
Gospel of the Nazareans
Basically an Aramaic translation of Matthew with some derivatives
Pre-Matthew final version, modified Matthew, or used Oral Tradition
Focus on upholding Jewish Law better than the Pharisees
Gospel of Ebionites
Combination of the Synoptics → a long Gospel Harmony
Abolition of animal sacrifice, radically demands vegetarianism, in fact
Gospel of the Hebrews
Gospel of the Egyptians, originated in Greece, named by a gentile
Gnostic slant, compilation of Oral Tradition, like Mark and John
Diatessaron - The most famous Gospel Harmony
Written in 170 C.E. by Tation which mean “through the four”
Gospel of Marcion
Revised Gospel of Luke without the Jewish connections
Uses Paul as his authority, removed positive references to Jewish Scripture
Removed birth narrative because it didn’t fit his Docetic view (Jesus as all divine, not flesh or human at all)
Tertullian - preserved much of Marcion’s Gospel because he beefed with it as a proto-orthodox Church Leader
Gospel of Thomas - “sayings” Gospel
Most significant find from the Nag Hammadi
114 sayings of Jesus, with no order or context : proverbs
Not Messianic, miracle working, or son of God → Jesus of eternal salvation via words alone → jai gnostic
More than half of the sayings can be found in the Synoptics
The other half is borderline nonsense → very cryptic (requires divine spark to understand)
Understanding all of the wisdom of Thomas grants eternal life
No resurrection or birth → Jesus’ early doings have little relevance, the book is about stripping the soul from the body to escape death
Written in Coptic, difficult to associate it with other Synoptics
Different from Q in its denial of a passion & resurrection which Q stressed
Gospel of Mary
Discovered in 1896, published in 1955
Follows Mary Magdalene
Gnostic, anti-materialist response from Jesus when Asked “will the material world be destroyed?” → Jesus answers only Mary, and her recollection to Peter is missing from the transcript
Only includes her description of the ascent of the soul
Other Nag Hammadi Texts
Apocryphon of John - Jesus reveals secrets of the Universe to John, Son of Zebedee
Origin of of the evil creator Ialdabaoth
Apocryphon of James - Dialogue with Peter and James 550 days after the Resurrection
Epistles of the Apostles - Supposedly a letter from the 11 to the Christian World, warning them of the false Apostles like Simon Magnus and Cerinthus, who were 2 infamous Gnostics
Infancy Gospel of Thomas - Jesus as a youth working Miracles
Dated around 125 C.E.
Young Jesus had a temper → kills other children and resurrects them, but eventually comes around to use his powers for good
Withers a school teacher
Ends with Jesus in the Temple, being praised by scribes
Proto-Gospel of James - about pre-birth holy family
Mar was miraculously born of an affluent family
Joseph won her hand in marriage via casting lots - as an old widower
Gospel of Peter - Passion narrative
Eusebius of the 4th Century wrote a lot about this one’s popularity in the 2nd Century, but we only know that it contained docetic christology
Banned book that we know little about
“He was silent, as if he felt no pain”
Fragment of the final page discovered in 1886 in a grave of an Egyptian Monk
Blames Herod for Jesus’ death
Somewhat similar to the synoptics → written after w/o reliance on them
The Coptic Apocalypse of Peter - Passion
From Peter’s point of view - from the Nag Hammadi
Negatively depicts Church Leaders who think Jesus' significance lies in his death
It is merely a release from his mortal shell → 3 Jesuses in the account
Ends with Peter “coming to his senses” and awaking from the Revelation
Gospel of Judas Iscariot - Passion
Most significant discovery of early Christian text in the past 50 years
Discovered in 1978 near Cairo
Mentioned by Irenaeus as used by the very secretive Gnostic Cainites
Opposed the lower deity → Creator God
Judas as a martyr → the only one who understand Jesus → makes it possible for Jesus to escape his mortal trappings
Does not include his crucifixion, ends w/ Judas deliverance of Jesus
In each of the last 2, Jesus laughs during his crucifixion at those who don’t understand who he is
Chapter 14: Historical Jesus and an Introduction to Apocalypticism
The most reliable sources are the Gospels which are conflicting texts, written decades after Jesus’ life, in a different language, based on Oral Tradition which had been circulating for some time…
Historians establish criteria so that sources can be evaluated for historical accuracy
Numerous accounts that can cross-referenced
Originated close to Jesus lifetime to mitigate exaggeration
Produced independently of one another → no collusion
Do not contradict each other
Internally consistent
Not biased so the subject supports author’s interests
Pagan / Jewish texts before 130 C.E. that mention Jesus
Very few, as if Jesus had 0 immediate impact
0 mention in pagan texts in that 100 year span
Pliny the Younger - 112 C.E. Roman governor of Bithynia-Pontus is the first to reference Jesus
Suetonius - Roman historian who wrote about Jewish riots around 41-54 C.E. which were instigated by one “Chrestu” → Christ
Tacitus - Roman historian, mentioned Christianity in his history of Rome, titled The Annals
Mentions how Nero user Christianity as the scapegoats for his burning of Rome → references Jesus’ death @ Pontius Pilate and the superstition that later emerged
Very few Jewish Texts from this period at all
Mishnah - Rabbinic opinions on Jewish Law published two centuries after Jesus died
Josephus - Provided insight on the Jewish war against Rome 66-73 C.E.
Authored a 20 volume history on Judaism from the Fall in the Garden through to 66 C.E.
Identifies Jewish high priest Ananus 62 C.E. who kills James “The brother of Jesus who called himself the Messiah”
Identifies Jesus as the Messiah in volume 18 → potentially modified later on by a Christian scribe
Christian Sources
Non-canonical Gospels published through the 8th Century
Little information outside of the New Testament can be considered Historical → most historical would be Paul who talks more about the cosmic truths than history
Constrains sources to the Gospels, written 40-65 years after Christ's death, most of which source Oral Tradition...
Ranking Sources in terms of historical value: Paul, Q, Mark, Matthew, Luke, Josephus
Must account for bias e.g. the Gospel of Peter blames Jewish Herod for Jesus’ death, slightly anti-semitic
Criterion for Independent Attestation - Negates the historicity of stories shared by the synoptics because mark could have lied, and both Matthew & Luke copied Mark
Exceptions include Baptism stories which appear in Mark | Q | John which are all independent of each other
Jesus' Brother James appears Mark | John | Paul
Seeds as a metaphor for the Kingdom of God Mark | Q | Thomas
Criterion of Similarity - If the history perfectly aligns with the theological motivations of the author, that’s kind of suspicious
Passing an agenda via Jesus’ mouth (e.g. the gentile mission)
Matthew very Jewish, Luke very gentile
Problem with this criteria is that it’s very likely that they overlap: presuppositions of the author AND what actually happened can both be true…
Criterion of Dissimilarity - More likely reliable if it can be shown to be different from the agendas of Judaism and Christianity
Best used to show what he did, not what he didn’t do
Things that are not Jewish, because Jesus was reforming Judaism
Things that are not Christian, because Christianity came after Jesus
E.g. Jesus baptized by John, which implies his spiritual inferiority, why include that unless it actually happened?
E.g. Betrayed by one of the 12
E.g. Jesus hanging out with tax collectors and sinners
Problem is that the things that are embarrassing/theologically challenging vary by culture
E.g. “Let the dead bury the dead” --Q 9:60
It doesn't make sense for Jesus to say that, the burial process was very important, and it’s not a thing that Christianity lost from Judaism either
Very Apocalyptic: You don’t have time to bury people, come follow me NOW
Problem is that Jesus was Jewish which is very similar to Px, so there’s probably a lot of things he said about which both agree
Criterion of Contextual Credibility - Things that just don't make sense
E.g. the Gospel of Philip referencing Sacraments of Baptism and the Eucharist which were non-existent yet.
Strictly negative application → used to identify things which did not happen
Criterion of Multiple Attestation - More likely to be reliable if it is preserved in two or more sources that are independent of each other
Most objective criterion → does not require interpretation
E.g. Parable of mustard seed appears in the Synoptics and the Gospel of Thomas
Jesus’ sayings of marriage appear in Mark and in Corinthians
Problem: lies could be injected into the Oral Tradition early on and there could be reliable things Jesus said or did that some authors didn’t like so they didn’t include
Criterion of Contextual Credibility - Things that make sense in the context of what we already know to be true
E.g. Jesus’ discussion with the tax collector in Matthew 18
Problem: Presuppositions about historical Jesus could lead to false conclusion and texts are always up for interpretation
Also depends on which criteria is used to establish “what we know”
What we do know about historical Jesus:
Galilean, born ~4 B.C.E
Likely baptized by John the Baptist and may have been following him until he amassed his own following
Wherever he preached, it upset the Romans and Jews
Spent passover week in Jerusalem where he did something (likely in the Temple) which got him in trouble
Arrested, crucified -- which is an exclusively Roman execution
Pontius Pilate is depicted as a tool → passes blame to the Jews, but historically, he got in trouble for his excessive crucifixions…
Rome gets antsy during Passover because it’s a Jewish celebration of their mantra that “God always liberates God’s people.”
Jesus comes in talkin bout liberation → looks like a terrorist, so they kill him
Jesus pisses off the Sadducees in the temple who go to Daddy’s $ → Romans
The claim to be God would only have pissed off Jews, Roman was highly polytheistic → blasphemy wasn’t a crime to them -- it was because of the political dissidence he was stirring up
This continues a trend of persecution spiking in 64 A.D. under Nero, as well as 250 A.D. when Germanic tribes were at the borders and internal Roman operations were crumbling
Large groups of Christians refusing to worship/make sacrifices to Roman Gods for the safety of the state
This posed a threat to the Roman state → easiest solution is to kill Christians
Jesus likely spoke in parables
How scholars understand Jesus
He was a Man of Spirit - a social prophet/sage
Jesus was non-Messianic → never claimed the title or his own agenda
core value was compassion
Prophet of Social Change - Cared for the welfare of the people
Entire ministry focused on relieving social maladies
Came to mediate and manifest the Kingdom of God -- very Lukan interpretation
The Apocalyptic Prophet - Most popular aspect of historical Jesus
John the Baptist → preached remission of sins bc the ends is near
Heavy Apocalyptic tones in Pauline Epistles → earliest Christian texts
Jewish Culture was a hotbed of Apocalypticism
Apocalypticism
There are forces of good and evil evident in every aspect of reality
God is good, but the world/present era is controlled by evil
God will come to destroy all evil and save the good which existed in the evil world
Humanity makes a fatal mistake (Garden of Eden), the repercussions are inescapable, and this changes the rules of society
A world view where a cataclysmic event changes the world order
General resurrection of the dead
Most Jewish groups, but not all e.g. Sadducees, would have believed in this
Final Judgement → Get it together
Satan’s supporters will be annihilated along with the supporters of the current world order
Blessed are the poor, not the rich, for they have benefited from the status quo
God’s supporters will enter a period of peace and happiness
Jewish Apocalypticism contended that there were 2 eras:
Present, evil era vs. the future era the Kingdom of God
The Messiah gathers and guides people to the Kingdom of God, namely Jesus
Israelites have been historically delivered from oppressors [by God] → So they’re literally waiting for another deliverance from Rome
Very prevalent during the mid-late 1st C. when the Jews were being rocked by the Romans → see destruction of the temple in 70 C.E.
Gives rise to apocalyptic thought, many Jews welcomed this because they wanted the coming era, the destruction of the Temple was an OBVIOUS trigger of the retribution of the Romans
Ancient Apoc. → believed the end of the world was coming very soon
In the 2nd and 3rd C., after Jesus still hadn't returned, early church leaders began to establish a hierarchy, rules, apostolic succession, doctrine, etc.
165 B.C.E, 70 C.E. large spikes in Apoc. texts written marking the beginning and end of the Jewish revolt :(
Apocalyptic Texts
Daniel - Earliest Apocalypse
Especially Chapters 7 - 12
Most important text for understanding how Jews saw themselves in the context of an Apoc. from Rome
Mark’s mini Apocalypse - Chapter 13
Matthew - Chapter 24
Luke - Chapters 21 and 17:27-37
1 Corinth - Chapters 15:20-28
Rapture Theory - Jesus returns and his followers begin to ascend to meet him
Stems from 1 Thessalonians
Antichrist Theory - Lawless man sets up shop in the Temple before the days of Lord
Stems from 2 Thessalonians
Chapter 15 - Excursus: The Problem of Miracles
“Miracles are impossible” - the Enlightenment
Apollonius of Tyana and Hanina ben Dosa - Jesus' contemporary miracle workers
Miracles were not performed by humans, but by Gods
Things that existed outside of the Natural Law before sciences caught up with them
Asclepius - Son of the God of Apollo known as a great God of Healing
Chapter 17 - Jesus: The Apocalyptic Prophet
Jesus’ preached an immediate apocalyptic perspective and message
Both Mark and Q portray Jesus as an Apocalypticist
Historically, we know that Jesus predicted the destruction of the Temple which is multiply attested in Mark and John
He calls the Temple a cult : “Den of Thieves” → similar to the Essenes who believed that worship of God had gotten out of hand and became ascetics
Sadducees abused their power → Daddy’s $
No need for the Temple when the Kingdom of God arrives → Jews would not have thought that this idea was very cash money
12 Disciples → very apocalyptic number, fulfillment of the 12 Tribes of Israel
Jesus’ association with tax collectors and sinners → Jewish leaders reject his mission, so he turns to those most in need of repentance in light of the imminent judgement
Associated with women in all four gospels which reinforces the apocalyptic message “last shall be first and first shall be last”
His exorcisms are multiply attested and not uncommon for a rabbi
Jesus’ healings and removals of sickness are the manifestations of the Kingdom of God which is without imperfection
All the these things portray Jesus as an apocalyptic prophet who foresaw the destruction of Israel/the Temple as a prefix to the entrance of the Kingdom of God
In response to the Da Vinci Code’s claims of his affairs with Mary Magdalene
Apocalyptic Jews (Essenes/Paul) were largely bachelors
Every. Single. Gospel. Canon or not lacks any mention of Jesus’ spouse/ child implicated by the book
Jesus erases marriage in the Kingdom of God
Sermon on the Mount stresses the reversal of status quo → get on board, relinquish your power in order to enter the Kingdom of God
Confession is a manifestation of the Pharisees’ push for a status quo
Jesus’ apparent rejection of family values:
Hate your mother, father, brothers, and sisters and turn to me
His own mother and father rejected his public ministry after all
Jesus likely knew his fate upon re-entering Jerusalem
Chapter 18 - From Jesus to the Gospels
Jesus’ resurrection was his initial claim to fame, his message was only put on blast afterwards, via the gospels
Christianity fundamentally was a belief in his death for sin, and his resurrection
Different from the religion he espoused → Religion of Jesus vs. the Religion about Jesus
Historically, Christianity begins with Jesus’s death and resurrection which sparked belief in his message
In some sense then, Christianity was founded by women
All the Gospels agree that some group of women encountered the empty tomb
However, Paul, the first Christian author, does not mention the empty tomb
Alternatively, the women are giddy and terrified -- unreliable, which is why their reports of the resurrection were not believed, explaining why Paul doesn’t mention them
First followers of Jesus, Apocalyptic Jews, wouldn’t have thought his death was for sin, but that God had raised him to ascend
Similarly, people who were believed to have been “exalted into heaven” were divinized - made into Gods : Enoch, Moses, Julius Caesar
Jesus’ resurrection influenced interpretation of his message → he claimed to be the Son of God, and referred to God as Father → strengthened his message
Messiah → ruler of the Kingdom of God, which arrived with the Son of Man → obey his teachings about how to implement the Kingdom of God
Before Jesus, no Jews believed that the Messiah would die for sins
Jews understood scripture to be a personal revelation of wisdom for coping with life
Psalms of Lament which speak about a: “righteous man who comes to suffer at the hands of God’s enemies and be vindicated”
Not viewed as Messianic until Jesus’ death and Px spread
Christians believed Jewish suffering in Psalms foreshadowed Jesus' passion → it was God’s plan the whole time
Isaiah - Wrote about the suffering of God’s righteous one
"Songs of the suffering servant"
Died for the sins of people → atonement
Interpreted to refer to Israel under Babylon, not Messianic until Christianity
Whereas crucifixion was viewed as a Jewish stumbling block (how could the Messiah be killed so shamefully?), it became the cornerstone of Christianity
Not a miscarriage of justice → part of God’s plan
“Son of Man” - from Daniel
Jews envisioned a cosmic ruler/Messiah
Pagans imagined just a human
“Son of God” - even more Messianic/kingly → anointed, not the image of a religious leader…
Once different canons were established, the differences in Gospels became homogenized rather highlighted
Vicarious Suffering - Originated with Jewish martyrs to describe dying to save others
Maccabean Revolt - Eleazar single handedly attacks an elephant who he thought was carrying the King of Syria → (((enemy of God)))
Gets crushed → “so he gave his life to save his people”
Chapter 20 - Paul, the Apostle
2nd to Jesus himself, Paul is the most important New Testament figure, authoring half the New Testament and spreading the Christian mission
Hebrews adopted into the canon later than a lot of other texts only because it was attributed to him, though it makes no such authorial claim
Paul was the strongest advocate for the gentile mission at a time when it would have made no sense people who were not “God’s people” could be saved
Preached that Jesus died for the salvation of the world, not just Israel
13 books attributed to him, but some were probably pseudonymous
Pseudepigrapha - “Writings inscribed in false hand”
Pauline Corpus
Undisputed (7)
Romans
1, 2 Corinthians
Galatians
Philippians
1 Thessalonians
Philemon
Probably pseudonymous (3)
Ephesians
Colossians
2 Thessalonians
Most certainly not Paul (3)
1,2 Timothy
Titus
Chronology (based on Acts, so take with a magnum grain of salt)
    c. 36     - Conversion -- more certain date than others
    46        - 49 - First mission → S. Turkey
    49        - Council of Jerusalem
    c. 52     - Second mission → Asia Minor and Greece
    c. 5x     - Third mission → Greece and Asia minor again
    58        - Arrest in Jerusalem
    60        - Journey to Rome
Pastoral Epistles - Instructions to churches as to how to operate : probably not written by Paul, just written under his name to push an agenda
Deutero-Pauline - “Second Paul” heavily influenced by Paul, but worked in alignment with his mission
Undisputed - Share style, vocab, theology, and context
Acts is accurate to Paul like Luke is accurate to Jesus
Paul’s own letters greatly differ from Acts
Acts/Luke says he went to Jerusalem after he converted to speak with the Apostles
Paul says he didn’t his message was straight from God, influenced by no man
Therefore, either Paul is a liar, or Luke was pushing a unification narrative
Paul is preaching to Pagans according to Acts → They’re misunderstood about God being God of all → sinful out of ignorance
Paul in Romans → attacks pagans for their willful idolatry and disobedience
His letters are occasional, not thematic and mass-listed for all of Christianity to consume → we have no comprehensive Pauline theology, only the fragments he highlight in response to the issues in his churches
He rarely refers to his own life, mostly the issues in his Churches
He does touch on his 3 stages though: life as a pharisee, conversion experience, activities as Apostles
Paul as a Pharisee
Well-off zealot for Jewish Law
Acts says he was from Tarsus, educated by a renowned Rabbi
Maybe just bumping his ethos → that’s like Ivy league Jew
His writing is demonstrative of his education tho
Only wrote in Greek, but might have known Hebrew/Aramaic
Paul Converts
As an apocalyptic writer, he would have believed in the resurrection
To most Jews, to call Jesus the messiah, who was crucified, and “cursed is anyone who hangs from a tree” was blasphemous
Converted as a young man → speaks of the “first fruits” of the resurrection
After he comes to believe that Jesus resurrected, he believes that he was truly the Messiah
Somewhat conflicting view on Jewish law
Only through observation of the Law → (faith) can we achieve salvation
But also strict adherence led to consequences
“Paul’s” letters (Undisputed)
Early letters: 1, 2 Thessalonians
Great Epistles: Galatians, 1, 2 Corinthians, Romans
2 Corinthians may be a collection Pauline letters → visible seams and needless repetition
Captivity Epistles: Philippians, Colossians, Ephesians, Philemon
Colossians and Ephesians have a distinct style and language from the Greater Epistles → Ephesians deliberately borrows words and ideas from earlier letters
Pastorals: 1,2 Timothy, Titus
Tells of post-captivity in the east, but there are several errors: household codes, church hierarchy that was never mentioned before (but now all the early church figures are gone...)
We know that Paul never met Jesus, but he becomes the most influential apostle, and the rest of the 11 are understandably apprehensive because they don’t really know what his message is, but they know that he’s out there establishing shurches in Jesus’ name months after he was stoning those same people...
Paul stoned a leader of the church : Stephen
Paul’s Conversion (Acts 9:3-18) contains many parallels to Genesis 46:2-7
Paul’s own story (1 Corinthians) does not match Acts
2 Types of Authority
Institutional - E.g. Apostolic succession, from tradition or law
Charismatic - From a vision (inspired by the Holy Spirit) → Paul doesn’t think he has to justify himself
Letters of Antiquity a genre
Paul did not wish for literary publication, but did expect them to be read aloud by the recipient to a congregation
His letters were treasured and ultimately led to the creation of books
Structure of an ancient Epistle:
I. Praescriptio - Epistolary prescript/greeting
“Paul to ____” or “Paul, Timothy, Philemon, and Titus to the church of ____”
Unclear who contributes which parts where though, therefore the letters are simply attributed to Paul
“Grace and Peace” → Jewish 'shalom,' but with a Christian shift because the Christian message is known as “the good news of the peace of Jesus Christ”
Grace is a gift, not earned, from God because he is merciful
II. Thanksgiving
“I give thanks to God for you and your faithful steadfast in the face of persecution” or whatever, in order to preface the theme of the letter
Paul does this very meticulously in EVERY letter except in Galatians because he’s mad at them
III. Body - The text based on the occasion of the letter
His response to big problems in the churches he previously founded
Sleeping with your step mother, speaking in tongues, the rich eating all of the supper, Christians suing other Christians, people eating idol meat, etc.
“Pauline theology” is shaky because he rarely speaks comprehensively, just what the audience needs to hear
IV. Conclusion - Short, personal conclusion, good wishes, closing blessing
“The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you always”
Chapter 21 - Thessalonians: the First Epistle
The first surviving letter of Paul, written over 15 years before Mark
Oldest book of the New Testament : ~49 C.E.
Audience is beloved to Paul, no real qualms prompting the letter
Writing to a church in Thessalonica, the capital of Roman Macedonia
Paul likely preached in synagogues to Jews and devout gentiles of the God of Israel
Probably preached for a few weeks before antagonistic Jews ran him out of town
We have no account from Paul though, just Acts... Paul just mentions the pagans of Macedon, not Jews and devout gentiles
He probably preached out of his tent shop accompanied by Timothy and Silvanus
Would have been received as ‘elite’ philosophers, as no other groups really did any 'converting'
Insula - Apartments in ancient, urban Rome → where Paul would’ve operated
Open First floor design was reserved for business/socializing
Convinced pagans to turn away from dead/false idols and towards the one True/living God
Stressed the Son of God, resurrection, and his return (a foreign concept to pagans)
Salvation by belief in the Son of God
Transformed pagans into apocalyptic Jews
Met in “House Churches”, semi-exclusive, distinct by worship to Paul’s message
Private/voluntary participation was not uncommon amongst other cults
Necessary to secure/fund burials of the members that would have been individually expensive
1 Thessalonians is very personable and loving → most of it is thanksgiving
Paul advises them not to engage in sexual immorality → keep image pure to the outside world
Christianity was already getting persecuted → shunned for sorcery etc., no need to fan the fire powering persecution
Major issue Paul addresses: loss of faith after members of the church community died before Jesus returned, so what happens to them?
Paul responds, they will be the first to enter into the KoG
Jesus comes for the living and the dead → but Paul expects to be alive when Jesus comes again
Chapter 21 - 1,2 Corinthians
Corinth was like the Las Vegas of the Roman Empire
Though this tarnished reputation actually came from Athens in a [successful] attempt to suppress the cultural authority of their rival
Paul writes to them for their interpersonal conflict and ethical impropriety
Condemns their one-upmanship of spirituality, lots of suing, and gluttony at the celebrations of the last supper
Audience is primarily uneducated gentiles, but some elite diversity
Declined their patronage → viewed this as “Putting the gospel up for sale”
Appears as though enough Corinthians were able to take the Gospel message as a starting point and extrapolate upwards (sometimes incorrectly) unlike the Thessalonians who struggled with his basic message
Never mentions Jesus’ baptism, transfiguration, preaching of the Kingdom of God, or Pontius Pilate → he’s writing before the gospels
His principle message was of Jesus’ crucifixion, resurrection, and his second coming
Unlike Thessalonians, Paul assumes the Corinthians have a working knowledge of Jewish Scripture
Uses Jewish quotations to stress the omnipotence of Jesus’ message
Calls them out for abusing the message to exalt themselves to glory
Paul hears of their wrongdoings via Apollos → a fellow Christian leader
Writes first to the people of “Chloe’s Congregation” - a wealthy, slave owning women, to address the factions that were forming as well as the criticism of his teachings he had received in previous letters
Jesus after the resurrection in “first fruits of Resurrection”
Corinthians are not exalted in their present state as they have not undergone spiritual transformation - 'they are but demons in their quarrels'
In thinking so, they overlook the very real dangers of evil in the present
They speak in tongues in mass to elevate themselves over each other
Deems marriage as the utility to temper sexual temptation, but if can you bear the gift of celibacy, do that instead
2 Corinthians
Follow up letter to the same community → indicates persistent religious issues
Dramatic tone shifts present within indicate that it is a compilation of several letters
CH 1- 9 : good terms with the congregation → joyful
Glad that they have repented for having treated him rudely
CH 10:13 : Bitter and incensed, warns that he will come to them for a third time “in judgement”
Addresses the Super Apostles - who perform signs → false apostles who cause disorder and disobedience
Likely the second half was written before the first half in response to his initial humiliation
Timeline of 2 Corinthians
1st Visit - Paul, Silvanus, Timothy → initial mission trip
1st Letter - Lost letter mentioned in 1 corinthians - dealt with ethical issues
1st Letter Back - Asking about more ethical issues, like can married people do sex???

2nd Letter (1 Corinthians) - Responds to their letter and conveys his plans to visit again
2nd Visit - Apparently visited, but was treated really poorly, threatens to return in judgement

Arrival of superapostles - False prophets of Gospel who cause dissent → “ministers of Satan”
3rd Letter (2 Corinthians, part 2) - Attacks the super apostles, Corinth is material and not glorified → does not intend to return again
4th Letter (2 Corinthians, part 1) - After they apologize, Paul is pleased with them agains
Believers will not be glorified until Christ comes again
Paul Hopes to be glorified with them
Unclear whether they ever got their act together or not
Chapter 22 - Galatians
Unlike Corinthians, Galatians follows a unitary message addressing a single problem
Other missionaries insisting on following parts of the Jewish Law in order to be made right before God: namely circumcision
Paul argues that this is not just unnecessary, but a misunderstood perversion of the Gospel message and an affront to God -- a rejection of Justification by Faith
He does not thank the audience, unlike all of his other messages
“Galatia” is the large vertical region with cities in the South including Antioch, Iconium, Lystra, and Derbe, but it also stretched North for a ways
Conflict between Paul and Acts → Acts says he founded churches in Galatia on a mission, but Paul said he merely converted some Galatians who nursed him while he was seriously ill
“A person is justified before God by not doing the works of Jewish Law, but by having faith in Christ.”
Parallels the Johannine message
Paul begins by establishing his divine authority in order to refute claims that Gentiles must partake in the fullness of Jewish covenants i.e. circumcision in order to partake in the fullness of Christianity
Those who have abandoned God by not trusting in Paul’s message are 'Cursed by God'
Segues into an autobiography to further establish his ethos
A prominent Jew, approaching the upper limit of pharisaical distaste for gentiles and Christianity
Also an inspired apostle → message straight from God → superior authority than Jerusalem
Only conferred with Jerusalem to touch base, not to “get the story straight” and at the Council of Jerusalem
Paul is vehement about this → “Before God, I do not lie”
Takes offense at the notion that there is a difference between Jew and Gentile before God that the other missionaries seemed to spread
If the law alone was sufficient, then Jesus need not have died
He includes a blessing, but no thanksgiving, because he wants to guilt them for the grace he mentions in the blessing → did they gain the Holy Spirit’s favor through Law, or by believing; through flesh, or through promise
Faith, like the faith of Abraham, the Father of Nations, not just the Jews is superior to the works
The law says that no one can follow all of the laws, and those who do not follow all the laws will be cursed
Adopts a Mattean response to the lawlessness that might follow the abandonment of the law that he seems to imply → “Christians are committed to each other in love → fulfillment of the Law”
Paul sees some laws as very Jewish (circumcision, keeping Kosher), and other as natural/Universal (love thine neighbor)
To circumvent the inability to keep all the laws, as the Law itself states → the Holy Spirit allows upright faith in God
Those non-believers are “ruled by the flesh, not the promise of the KoG”
Chapter 23 - Romans: The Gospel According to Paul
Longest and most sophisticated letter of the Pauline Corpus
Closest thing to a summary of Pauline theology that we have → shaped Christian theology for centuries to come
Writing to a church he did not establish, therefore it is unburdened by a solution to their problems, since Paul didn’t know them
However, as his audience did not know him, his credibility/education is very important to give his letter authority
Not writing to address a specific problem, instead preaching his interpretation of the Gospel
Perhaps writing to them to ask for support for his Western Church → the Roman church was huge and important
Writes to address their shaky perception of him (he who abolished Jewish Law?)
Follows the ancient rhetorical style of diatribe → as a student of Platonic dialectic
Advances a thesis and then disproves legitimate counterpoints
Shows that the author has authority and is always right
Romans would have appreciated the rhetorical style
Writes to persuade his opposition within the Church of Rome about the truth of the Gospel message: Jews and Gentiles are equal in the eyes of God and equally saved by Christ’s resurrection
“The one who is righteous will live by faith”
Part of his opening statement, likely comes from an early Christian creed as it is distinct from his usual style, but would be familiar to his audience
First - Paul is not ashamed of the Gospel → he is very confident in it (from God)
Second - Paul's Gospel is God’s powerful means of salvation → apart from Paul’s Gospel, there would be no salvation
Third - Salvation comes to those who have faith → Paul demands justification (to be made right before God)
Fourth - Salvation comes first to the Jews, then the Gentiles → Jews are the chosen people of God and his Law, but they are equal to Gentiles in terms of Judgement
Fifth - The Gospel reveals the righteousness of God → God has not forsaken his covenant with the Jews, but Jesus fulfilled that covenant through his passion, so that all might be saved
Sixth - Scripture proclaims the Gospel → cites Jewish scripture to the Romans who respected the ancient religion
No formal Gospel exists yet, so Paul is referring to his own message which was revealed by God
Paul’s models for salvation
Judicial - Mankind is on trial for its sins before God
The penalty is death, because god is Just → the human condition is death for its sins
God is merciful (by grace) and Jesus is without sin, his death pays for everyone else's
Grace is undeserved, unearned → through belief in the Death and Resurrection
Participationist - Sin as a cosmic force that must be escaped
Sin enslaves people and Jesus Redeems (purchases) us from sin
Jesus’ resurrection demonstrated that he was not subject to this force
Baptism unites us in Christ, allowing us to participate in his death and Resurrection → Jesus abides in us
Undergo a transformation of identity
In one model, sin is willful, in the other its enslaving
Flow of Paul’s argument
Human condition - Everyone sins and dies equally before God
Divine solution through Jesus' Death - Jewish Law focuses on sin, but proposes no solution. Jesus’ death makes everyone righteous before God
Gospel message rooted in Sacred Scripture - Abraham was justified through works, obedience, and by trusting his faith → Christianity inherited this covenant
The Death and Resurrection bring freedom - Flesh is subject to sin which died in Christ
A Law-free Gospel does not lead to lawlessness - Self-sacrificial love in Christ becomes the new Law
Close of the Letter - Greetings to specific members of the congregation
Summary
I. Praescriptio - Opens with a warm Greeting to the pre-established church which foreshadows the main points to follow
His message conforms with what God has promised to Christianity
Ties legacy to Judaism by tying it to prophets and scripture
They’re obligated to spread the mission of Christianity and crucified Christ
Those who receive it are undeserving, but receive grace nonetheless
II. Thanksgiving - Thanks them for their “faithfulness,” announces his plans to visit
“One is justified in God by faithfully responding to his call"
Through God’s grace we are justified, so we better just be faithful
Playing it nicer to the Big Powerful Roman Church
Paul's Pride and Joy is
his good news, mission
that the Romans share it
III. Body - Expression of Pauline Theology
Sinfulness of Gentiles - worshipping of created rather than creator
Distinguishes Christians from Jews - yet there is no difference in Jew and Gentile in the eyes of God because of Jesus’ crucifixion
God is knowable from the Natural Order by creation alone - creation is orderly
Humans beings get fixated on the world itself, rather than seeing it as a reflection of God’s benevolence → inability to see past this world
This leads to other sins: sexual immorality, idolatry, etc.
Idolatry gives rise to every other sin: worshipping the world, not its creator
This argument sounds very Jewish → who the Romans viewed as very traditional
Paraprosdokian - Pulls the rug out from under them “it was Christianity the whooole tiiime”
People judging others - those who judge others are “storing up God’s wrath”
Not concerned with individual hypocrisy as much as the group political claims → Jews are inferior, etc.
God judges people by their deeds, not by their group identity, and he is impartial → Paul condemns judgement as badly as idolatry
Jewish judgement of the Gentiles - the chosen people have a high moral standard, but they don’t follow all the laws the espouse, giving them a bad name among gentiles → making God look bad
Your actions can undercut your salvation
Sin is a universal reality → no one is free from it because God is a just God
God serves death for sin → everyone dies
If sin is the problem, God’s response is gracious justification opportunity through Jesus
The Old Testament God is Just; and it's the same God in the New Testamnet, but he sent Jesus who was crucified for our sins allowing for mercy
Humans are required to have faith in what God has done through Christ
We can be redeemed (“purchased”, slavery connotation) from our oppressive sins. Bought back in Christ via faith
Various models of salvation from Paul
God’s actions via Jesus are full of grace in that we do not even deserve the opportunity for salvation
Paul crafts a dualistic image of God
God is Just and we will die
God is loving and merciful via Jesus whose death redeems our sins → faith is the only appropriate response
Chapter 24 - Paul in Relation to Jesus, James, Thecla, & Theudas
Did Paul and Jesus represent the same religion?
Members of Pauline churches certainly told stories about Jesus which could have eventually become the Oral Tradition of the Gospel
Paul rarely says anything about historical Jesus other than:
Born of a woman as a Jew, had brothers, one of whom was named James
Conducted his ministry among Jews
Had a last supper on the night he was betrayed
Knows what Jesus said at the Last Supper
Knows that Christians should not get divorced and should pay their preachers
Paul parallels some of Jesus’ teachings: pay taxes, obey the law, and love their neighbors → but he does not attribute these teaching to Jesus
Things he doesn’t include:
Parents, early life, baptism, wilderness
Kingdom of God, no parables, healings, transfigurations, cleansing of the Temple
No interrogation by the Sanhedrin or Pontius Pilate
Option 1 → no occasion to mention these things
He clearly knew the apostles would have been telling these stories
Never mentions stories to converts because he opened with them in his mission → they would have already known them
However, most of his letters are reminders of what he already taught them...
Paul had ample opportunity to use stories to support him, but he rarely did...
Option 2 - Considered Jesus stories irrelevant to his mission
Jesus' death and resurrection are of most import
But he still cites Jesus often...
Option 3 - He just didn’t know enough about Jesus
Nonetheless, he and Jesus agree on a lot: monotheism, covenants with Israel, Apocalypticism
Jesus still maintains Jewish Law, but Paul says no amount of obedience is greater than faith
Paul thinks faith alone vs. James faith and works model
Probably had different definitions of “faith” and “works”
Thecla - Takes Paul’s celibate advice to heart and ends her engagement to follow the Apostles
Theudas - Teacher of the infamous 2nd century gnostic Valentinus
Said to have been a disciple of Paul
There were several sects of Pauline Christianity
Chapter 25 - In The Wake of Paul: Deutero-Pauline Epistles
Pseudepigrapha - A work authored under a false name/somebody else’s name
A field of study for advanced students: forgery/imitation
Sometimes documents were signed under their teacher’s name in an act of humility/attribution of the containing knowledge to that person
Writing that makes an authorial claim, unlike the Gospels
Homonymous - A writing attributed to someone of the same name
John of Revevelation and John of Zebedee
Deutero-Pauline Epistles - Ephesians, Colossians, 2 Thessalonians
Pastorals - 1, 2 Timothy, Titus
2 Thessalonians - most contested Pauline Epistle
Claims to be written by Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy
Likely written in the late 1st century, after Paul’s death
Written to Christians who were suffering for their faith
1, 2 Thessalonians are verbatim in several places, but have very split eschatologies
Repeated insistence that Paul is the author, and that people should not believe in other texts written under his name
Typical tactic of Pseudepigrapha: “don’t believe others, but I am true”
Author discounts “whatever an earlier letter from ‘Paul’ may have said, do not be deceived” -- Quoth the deceiver
Theological differences
Delayed arrival of the Kingdom of God: “Do dead people go to heaven?”
Uncontested 1 Thessalonians says yes, and they go first
2 Thessalonians says: worldwide signs will indicate the end of days and the coming of the KoG: rebellion, lawless one revealed
2 Thessalonians says Jesus will return to defeat the antichrist
Pretty huge chunk of theology here, why wouldn’t Paul mention it elsewhere?
The rest of Paul’s undisputed corpus says “the end is coming ASAP like a thief in the night” ← 1 Thessalonians
Counter-argument: someone claiming to be Paul wrote to the Thessalonians saying that Jesus returned and the Kingdom of God is upon them, so they stop working because the full realization of the Kingdom of God is like 1 day away.
Explains 2 Thessalonians authorial claim and the disparate ‘end of days’ theology, it’s like a clarification for them to get back to work
Written to address those who thought that the day of judgement had already arrived
Describes how they will know the apocalypse is here/coming
Anti-Christ -- unique to 2 Thessalonians
People believed it was so imminent/present that they quit their jobs and became a social burden on the rest of the Christian community
1 Thessalonians says “it will come like a thief in the night”, 2 Thess says there will be several advanced warnings
Antichrist - A central focus of 2 Thessalonians which is not mentioned anywhere else but is a pretty big portion of this author’s theology
So, who wrote 2 Thessalonians? Someone being persecuted as a Christian in the 1st century, either by a Jew or Roman
Probably post 70 C.E., and they must have had access to 1 Thess. Bc of the verbatim agreements
Perhaps saw himself as a Pauline Christian
Colossians
Written by “Paul” in prison, addressing the false teachers in Colossae
Addressed to a church that the author did not found (explains why he had to claim Paul’s name for authority)
Condemns the false “philosophy and empty deceit” → but does not specify what these teachings are, assumes his audience knows
Some form of Judaic traditions: Kosher and Circumcision
Christ is the fulfillment of the Old Testament, therefore maintain your good Christian faith until he returns
Writing style differs greatly from the undisputed Pauline Corpus
Author says that Christians have died and risen in Christ, but Paul says that we have died, and are still awaiting resurrection in Christ
Beginning of the instantiation of “household rules” that are not present in earlier Christian writing because the apocalypse was imminent, so it didn’t matter
Insistent claim of authorship
Hard to distill whether or not it’s undisputed because Paul never published a comprehensive theology as he usually wrote to address specific issues
This author thinks: Christians “have already been raised in Christ”
But not a physical, literal resurrection
Undisputed Paul disagrees AND believes in a physical resurrection → but it will happen in the future, not already, as the author of Colossians says
Contains lengthy exhortations which imply a larger, more established church than the ones that existed/were addressed in the undisputed corpus
Needs more rules, since we’ve been resurrected, and we’re now a bigger church
Suggests a later time period than when Paul wrote
Discusses Judaizers similar to those in Galatians
Says that the requirements of the Law have been erased by the crucifixion, unlike Galatians which says it was only superseded
Opponents in Colossae taught “worship of angels” and perhaps advocated a more mystical Judaism or even Jewish gnosticism
Author says Jesus created other invisible beings (angels) for Jesus, and that Jesus is superior and only Jesus can grant salvation
“Paul” is writing to curb this degree of Jewish mysticism
Similar to Neo-Platonism which said that you can contact God through vertically networking the cosmos by intermediary lesser beings
Author gives specific instructions based on class: wife, slave, poor, rich
Paul never does that: God is impartial → Jew, Gentile, Rich, Poor, it don’t matter
Christ hymn of Colossians 1:15-20 : "for in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell” -- Philippians is similar, containing the earliest Px writings
Likely not invented by the authors, but were commonly included in thanksgiving
Philip references a letter to the Laodiceans which is not present in the canon because it fucking sucks lol, viewed as the driest copy/paste of Pauline themes: “the most worthless piece of writing in Px literature” -scholars
Ephesians
Not really disputed that Paul did not author this book
Very different style from the undisputed Corpus: very long sentences
Very different vocab: lots of words that Paul uses nowhere else
Writing from prison to a gentile Christian Church → not explicitly Ephesus
Ephesus added later, the original was probably a circulated letter
Overarching theme is that even though gentiles were once alienated from God, they have now been united with Israel as God’s favored people by Christ’s passion
How to live in the ways that manifest this unity
No specific problem that he addresses because there was no specific audience
Super long sentences compared to undisputed Pauline corpus
Works as good deeds, vs. works of mosaic law
Betrays knowledge of Colossians (Spiritual resurrection has already occurred) w/many verbatim agreements as well
Author of Ephesians concedes that he leads a more sinful life than what Paul concedes in his epistles
Vastly different theology than the undisputed corpus as well
Different ideas about Judaism in general
Author appears to be a 2nd generation Christian, and refers to salvation in the past tense (as it has already happened), Paul contends that it is yet to come
Ephesians establishes more rules for church hierarchies and refers to the Apostolic era in the past
PASTORALS → undisputed that they are not Pauline, advice to Titus and Timothy as to how they should run their churches
Focus on silencing false teaching and internal organization/operation
Deal with church orders and an institutionalized church that did not exist in the 1st century
Apocalyptic Christians wouldn’t have cared about church structure
Different writing style and Christian vocab that didn’t exist until the 2nd century
Different use of concepts and treatment of women than Paul held
“Faith” refers to the religion as a whole vs. Paul’s faith as a personal belief/response to God’s mercy through Jesus Death and Resurrection
“Righteous” = moral, vs. Pauline “Made right before God” - which is more specific
1 Timothy and Titus are almost certainly by the same author due to their united focus on Church structure and social dogma
2 timothy is different but the style/structure is consistent with the other 2
⅓ of the vocabulary in the pastorals is not found anywhere else in the Pauline Corpus
In 1, 2 Corinthians, Paul addresses the entire church instead of the leader, simply because there was no explicit structure yet, so these don’t make sense
His churches were “charismatic communities”- congregations of people who believed they had been endowed with God’s spirit and gifts (charismata) → no one was in charge, except Paul, but he wasn’t there
50 years after his death, with the apocalypse still not there, the proto-orthodoxy began to emerge, instituting official roles
Bishop = Episkopos = overseer
Presbyters = elders = tended to the spiritual needs of the community
Deacons = ministers = tended to the material needs of the community
Ignatius - 2nd century church leader writes about such structures
Pastoral authors quote the New Testament which didn’t exist or weren’t circulated around the time of Paul
Refer to Jesus word as scripture → viewed as as authoritative as Old Testament which wasn’t the case during Paul’s time
Concern for widows/orphans/etc. Since Jesus has not yet come back
Established women losing church rights: no talking, leadership, and Eve is the source of sin in the world
Paul had several female colleagues, was not a sexist → “God is impartial”
1 Corinth: “Women shouldn’t speak in Church” which is believed to be a later addition, as Paul does not have that attitude anywhere else
1 Timothy
Addresses curtailing the arising gnostic sects
How to pray, treat the elderly, widows, and church leaders, what to avoid, etc.
Lambastes false teachings against marriage and keeping Kosher
Only Male, morally upright people can hold church leadership: bishops, deacons
Ambiguous about their specific duties though
Women cause trouble
2 Timothy
Paul is in prison writing to Timothy encouraging him to keep up the good work and come visit him when he can
Learn more about Timothy: a 3rd Generation Christian
Commends him for overcoming the false teachings of those leading the saints of the community away with their idle teachings
Urges him to continue his ministry in Ephesus until he can come visit Paul in Rome
Titus
Corrects false teachings of the Jewish-Christians
Advice to the various social groups in Titus’ church
Chapter 27 - The Christians & the Jews: Hebrews & Barnabas
Hebrews and The Epistle of Barnabas explain how Jesus’ religion went from Jewish to Anti-Jewish in a single century
Catholic Epistles - 1, 2, 3 John, Timothy, Titus, etc. general epistles not written by Paul
Self-definition - How early Christians came to distinguish themselves from Jews → groups defined in opposition to one another
Adoptionists - Such as the Ebionites, believed Jesus was man, then was adopted by God
Christianity continued to be driven inward, requiring conversion for admission via special rites such as baptism and Lord’s Supper
To the Romans, Christians look like people who aren’t members of the pagan cult which prays for the welfare of the state, they don’t practice Judaism, but they worship the same Jewish God… looks like Px are exploiting a loophole
Hebrews portrays Jewish Law as impartial and imperfect, highlighting its inadequacy as an Old Covenant
Hebrews does not follow the form of an epistle, unknown author and audience, no thanksgiving or prayer etc.
Likely just a transcribed Sermon
Part of the canon because 3rd/4th century Christians attributed it to Paul
Not written by Paul: style, topics, theology are all distinct from Paul
Origen - Christian scholar of the 3rd century: “No one knows who wrote it :p”
Audience are almost certainly persecuted Christians, likely gentile converts, not Jewish
Author is writing to assure them that Christianity is superior Judaism, that it’s worth being distinct
Different translations of Hebrews present very different christological views :
Jesus as wholly God, vs. Jesus as wholly man… depending on the placement of “of God” in translation from Greek…
Themes of Superiority of Christ
superior to the prophets - they merely paved the way for Christ
Superior to the Angels - they are the messengers of God << Son of God
Superior to Moses - servant in God’s House, Jesus is God’s house
Superior to Joshua - who delivered only temporary peace to Israel, Jesus grants eternal peace
Superior to the Jewish priesthood - priests are required to mediate between God and Man for human imperfection, they descend from Levi - but Jesus descends from Melchizedek, who was honored by Abraham
Additionally, priests must repeat sacrifices, Jesus only made a single sacrifice
Minister of the superior covenant - God says the old covenant is not good enough, Jesus bears the new Covenant
Superior Tabernacle - Christ raises his sacrifice to heaven whereas the Jewish Law is bound to the Earth
Superior sacrifice - Perfect, complete, for all sins, one time only
Hebrews author of Jesus is heavily reliant on Judaism if only to elevate Christianity above Judaism
Argues that jewish law awaits greater fulfillment by God (similar to Matthew)
Discusses how God makes old covenants obsolete in the Old Testament → the same thing happened with the covenant of the Law, obsolete in the face of Jesus’ death and resurrection
The Old Testament Tabernacle and Jewish Law are inferior shadows of Jesus and the salvation he brings
Once you have experienced the reality of Christ, there is no turning back, for that is like actualizing Jesus’ crucifixion, and then turning your back to him
Harsh Old Testament punishments for turning away from the imperfect covenants… what would happen if you turn away from the perfect covenant: Jesus
Uses graphics imagery to exhort Christians not to fall away from their faith in the perfect covenant - in response to their weakened spirits, having been persecuted for being Christians, not Jews
Ends with specific advice against sins like impropriety etc. (the classics)
Likely written towards the end of the 1st Century
Focuses on Anti-Judaism for the sake of defining Christianity, not for the sake of hatred itself
Christianity must therefore assume a very defensive posturing
Barnabas - Paints Judaism as a false religion from the outset, the Old Testament has always been Christian
Unknown author → attributed to Barnabas to bolster authority, unlikely
Likely written around 130 C.E “when people still though that the Temple might be rebuilt”
Philo - 1st century Jewish Philosopher in Alexandria → uses allegorical means of interpreting Jewish scriptures just like the author of Barnabas (instead of a literal interpretation)
Whereas Philo used it to support Judaism, Barnabas uses it to attack
Barnabas uses allegory to explain why the Jews are wrong
From him we get the 6,000 year old creation story and the 1,000 year bliss → idea was common in the middle ages
Argues that the Law is supposed to inform ethical behavior, not be taken literally
Some things are literal though, like circumcision → prefigured by 318
Gematria - Interpreting words in their numerical value
318 = tau, iota, eta = τ ι η = t plus the first two letters of Jesus’ name
Therefore circumcision prefigures Px and is true
Two ways of Life - According to Barnabas, light vs. dark
Justin - Roman philosopher
Meclito - Sses analogy to claim that Israel killed its own God
Chapter 28 - Christians and Pagans: 1 Peter, Ignatius, the Martyrdom of Polycarp, and Late Apologetics
Christianity was never illegal, rather Christians were persecuted for rabble rousing
After they departed from Judaism, Christians opened the door to scrutiny as they were no longer respected like Judaism
Christians had little significant impact on the Roman empire for several centuries
0 letters from the mid-1st Century mention Jesus
Not until 250 C.E. did emperor Decius enact empire-wide persecutions
To establish a new cult and proclaim a person as divine was well within the bounds of the law
Rome had no empire-wide, uniform criminal code: governors’ Jurisdiction offered a lot of freedom
Pilate was entirely justified in killing Jesus for being a public nuisance in the eyes of the Roman Law
Christians were persecuted for disturbing the peace, not for being Christian
Families were disrupted when members were converted : “hate your mother, father, brothers, and sisters → Love Jesus”
Perpetua - Roman women + slave Felicitas who took martyrdom willingly even though their families pled for them not too
Christians met at night, brother and sister, to hold a “love fest” (Lord’s Supper), which involved ritual kissing, consumption of blood and flesh...
Incest, orgies, infanticide, cannibalism
Refused to partake in any other cults, including the state-cults
Roman historian Tacitus - Calls Christianity a “Pernicious superstition” and claimed that Nero could use them as scapegoats for burning Rome
Suetonius - Biographer - describes Christianity as people who held to novel mischief
Pliny the Younger - “Obstinate, mad adherents to a depraved superstition”
Marcus Aurelius - Considered Christianity to be misguided
Nero - 1st person to overtly persecute Christians → feeds them to dogs
Condemns them for his own arson, still not for being Christians though
Trajan - Corresponded with governor Pliny who publicly condemned and executed the trouble-causing Px → crime: not worshipping Roman gods
Still not for being Christians
Persecution led to increased solidarity within Christianity and further devotion of theological concepts
1 Peter - Written in the name of Peter to “the exiles of dispersion” in Asia Minor
Circular letter, to Christians who are waiting for the salvation
Or, actual resident aliens: slave < X < citizen
Ironically, pagan opposition was likely the largest catalyst for Christian growth
Urges them morally and legally to be “obedient slaves, submissive wives, tender husbands, and good citizens”
Disruption of social structure caused by Christianity leads to public outcry
Letters of Ignatius of Antioch
Letters to Christian communities as he traveled through Asia Minor to be thrown to the beasts in Rome for his rabble-rousing activities
Looks FORWARD to his martyrdom
Bishop of Church in Antioch, Syria, which he left in disrepair due to internal conflict
Also wrote a letter to Polycarp of Smyrna
Insists on Christian unity, pure doctrine, and Church hierarchy
“Regard the bishop as the Lord himself” - Bishop Ignatius...
Writes to the Roman Christians, ordering them not to interfere with his coming martyrdom
Pathological or pious? → martyrdom was the surest form of salvation → eager
Martyrdom of Polycarp
Born in 60-65 C.E. → executed in 156 C.E., claimed to serve Christianity for some 80 years
Betrayed by his own friends, refused to escape arrest, did not burn at the stake though, instead smelled like delicious spices so the Romans had to pierce him → so much blood poured out of him, it doused the fire
Likely fictional excluding his cause for execution: refusing to denounce Christianity to avoid a terrible death
Christianity begins to welcome persecution
Later Christian apologists use the spread of Christianity in the face of persecution as evidence for its superiority
Christianity gave rise to many popular polytheistic tenets: resurrection, heaven, son of God, virgin birth, miracles
Write to Romans saying the best approach would be to just leave Christians alone
Argued for separation of Church and state until Constantine adopts Christianity
Martyr - Someone who suffers persecution or dies due to adherence to religious beliefs
Greek = “witness”
Thecla was prepared to die in the colosseum, but survives, still revered as a martyr
In the 5th/6th century, once Rome is no longer persecuting, Christians decide that renouncing the world is a form of Martyrdom → rejecting material goods
Isolated persecution in 64 C.E. under Nero
Lit Rome with burning crucifixes → crazy/paranoid
Burned 1/3rd of Rome to the ground to expand royal palaces, blames Christianity
Tacitus says: “Convicted, not so much of the crime of firing the city, as much as hatred of mankind”
Christianity, rather than arson, is their crime
Persecution - Criminalization of beliefs, crimes for belief instead of actions
It’s unclear, so when epistles say “persecution” does that simply mean social exclusion, or getting stoned, somewhere in between?
Martyrdom and persecution occur immediately after Jesus’ death
Peter denied Jesus 3 times and all the disciples flee the cross for fear
Sporadic persecutions:
Nero, France (117 C.E.),
Ignatius (110),
Nationwide policy (250)
Christians and Jews were beefing often between 60-70, Rome getting pissed off
Timeline
64 - Nero burns Rome and blames Christians
Early 2nd century - Sporadic persecutions throughout the empire
Mid 2nd century - More sporadic persecutions → beginning of martyrdom narratives
249-251 - Decius implements aggressive, nationwide policy of compelling Christians to make sacrifices on behalf of the emperor
284-305 - “Great persecution” under Diocletian
Ignatius of Antioch
Dies in 117, bishop, eager to die as a Christian → completion/perfection of Faith
Christianity becomes treason because they refuse to worship the state Gods
Christian population SPIKES after every empire-wide persecution
Lot of integrity in dying for what you believe in
Paul believed he did miracles, Christians believe he did, so it grows
Martyrdom dampens finality of death → conviction of salvation
Pliny - Writes to Trajan to ask what defines the guilt of a Christian?
Interrogates people who confessed to Christians 3 times
Persecution for refusal to assimilate to Rome
“If you’re not a Christian, burn incense and offer libations to/for the Emperor”
Forbids their political associations → Christians cannot publicly meet
Executes, tortures, and captures a ton of Christians → inquiring to Trajan what he ought to do with them
Christians was not an issue until people realized that they were not worshipping the state Gods
Some Christians provoked the Romans in order to get martyred because it guaranteed heaven
Polycarp says you ought to resist and meet martyrdom head on
Persecution in France under Marcus Aurelius the Stoic
Threat from the Germanic tribes to the North: need standardized cult worship to state Gods
“On the the Functions of the Provincial Governor” → contained advice for how new governors should treat Christian communities
Decius’ empire-wide order → very hard to enforce
When Romans performed sacrifices, they received a libellus, libelli
Proof of Libation to “someone”
Tertullian - Says the charges against Christians were for “lying to be a Roman Religion”
Valyrian - Says Roman religions must practice Roman rites (sacrifices)
Implies that Christianity is not a Roman Religion
Diocletian - The empire is collapsing around him from the North and South
Romans turn inwards to traditional Roman religion
Tries to consolidate the empire, as a result, Christian groups are exiled, executed, etc.
Demanded that everyone perform sacrifices for the empire
303 → Christianity made explicitly illegal
311 → Made legal again
312 → Constantine makes it the official religion of the empire
Christianity grew so ******* fast : as fast as the contemporary Mormon church → 40%/decade
Chapter 29 - Women in the Early Church: Intersection of Gender and the Apocalypse
Acts of Paul and Thecla - Widely circulated independently of the larger text which focuses on Paul
The story of Thecla is exceedingly popular → rewarded as a saint, gains a cultish following around the Mediterranean basin
The tomb she’s buried in, beneath the location of a monastery built to her in the 4th century, was built in the late 1st century/early 2nd century → super old, in Syrian warzone currently
Near Damascus → nuns in the monastery were previously ransomed by Al-Qaeda and the monastery will probably not survive the next decade
Mary, Mother of Jesus - Mentioned in all the gospels, Luke’s narrative in particular talks about how she’s been blessed by God and chosen to give birth to the Messiah
Anna - Prophecies about Jesus’ coming
Woman who anoints Jesus - “Lived a sinful life”
Samaritan Woman - In John's Gospel, water of Life story
Mary and Martha - Jesus visits the homes of women to teach them
Women at the tomb - Multiply attested that they were the first (the specific identities are hazy)
Mary Magdalene - One of Jesus’ closest followers, one of the women at the tomb
Heretical theories about Romantic relationship between her and Jesus
Somewhat revered - Gnostic Gospel of Mary depicts her as the “Beloved Disciple”
Had legion, was exorcised → devout follower
Archetype of Redemption
Implied that she is the one who anoints Jesus in Bethany, but that’s somewhat uncertain
Each of the Gospels say that she was present at the death and the resurrection
Financially supports and travels with the disciples → never named as a prostitute, but that is the rumor/assumption made about her
Thought to be the adulterous woman in John “whoever among you is without sin, let him cast the first stone”
Retconned into John by later gospels, not to demonstrate a moral story, but to prove that Jesus could read
The rumor of her role as a “prostitute” Started in the 6th C.
At Jesus’ passion, all the disciples leave and he is left with only his female followers
Women in Pauline Corpus
Phoebe - Deacon, leader of the Church at Censuree → entrusted to carry the initial Letter to the Romans
Prisca - Gentile convert, addressed along with her husband, but she is mentioned first
Mary - Colleague in the church
Junia - Referred to as “foremost among the Apostles”
This titel got 18th century scholars’ panties in a knot
Paul says “no Jew nor gentile, man nor woman” is free from judgement
He views them equally: his whole message is that God is impartial
Yet he distinguishes between them e.g. women should cover themselves in a veil while praying
Says that they should not speak in church, but this is from a pastoral epistle which indicates that it is not in fact Pauline
Fathers of the Church on Women
Tertullian - “you are the devil’s gateway … destroyed the image of God”
Wrote a whole book about what a woman could wear, down to the gemstone
Used to be a montonist → did not believe in the Holy Spirit, apostolic era had not ended, believed that women were important prophetesses
Eventually abandoned that sect for orthodoxy
Clement of Alexandria - “Womens’ very consciousness of the own nature must evoke shame”
Jerome of the Vulgate - “Root of all evil”
Origen - women must not speak in congregation, regardless of what they have to say, it is bad because it came from the mouth of a woman
Augustine of Hippo - Women have no purpose to man but to bare children
etc...
But there also exist martyrological, apostolic texts from earlier in the church
Gospels / Acts of Thecla, Mary Magdalene, Mary Mother of God
4 people ever immaculately conceived (born without sin): Adam, Eve, Mary, and Jesus
Mary didn’t need to be baptized because she was already blessed by God’s grace
As the proto-orthodox sect grows, Church leaders become increasingly motivated by patriarchal concepts such as the veneration of the 12, and get enough power to filter out women → authority of what is/isn’t heretical
Sexuality in the early church
Hecla, aristocratic woman, decides to become a celibate nun
Viewed as a threat to Roman state, as she was not producing heirs
Early apostolic texts promoted Asceticism in the 2nd/3rd century
Afterwards, lots of church doctrine was released regarding the pros of marriage
Romans believed 3-5 children/wife was good for the state
Celibate Christians were really tearing up Roman social constructs as they believed, to an extent, that children were worldly things and were of no use in the apocalypse
Paul said celibacy was most the best, but better to be married than to burn in hell
Later we get puritan reformers who say that marriage is, in fact, superior celibacy
Believed that sexuality reinforced God given hierarchies → men penetrate and women are penetrated
Sex was solely procreative in the absence of contraception → 'lovemaking' did not exist
That understanding has significantly changed over time
LGBT arguments pertaining to relationships? Or sexual acts?
Jesus never addresses homosexuality
“Man and woman were yoked together and should not be separated”
Responding to divorce, not sexual impropriety
Paul talks about sex a lot
Humans are to worship the creator, not the created
Sex is idolatrous because it is the worship of the created
“Man and woman gave themselves up to passion”
“Exchanged glory of god for glory of creatures”
Talks about lesbian and gay sex, but he’s attacking sex on the whole, not those specific varieties → does not talk about celibate homosexual relationships
In ancient Rome, sexuality was a degree of perfection
Rocks-----plants--animals----women/slaves--men----God (logos)
People lower down on the spectrum were less capable of rationality
It is ok for men to penetrate women because it is a reflection of the god’s spectrum of sexuality
A senator penetrating a slave is ok, but the opposite is not
Rome was all about reproducing the spectrum of intellection
Lots of hierarchical “use” outside of sex
Everyone less than you is subservient
Arsenokoités
Term used by Paul in condemnation of something
“Going to bed with Men”
Idiom that didn’t necessarily mean anal sex
Used elsewhere to refer to financial exploitation
Literally means “Man fucker” but like getting screwed over financially
Paul lists sins: “idolaters, adulterers, Arsenokoités, thieves, and robbers.”
Depending on how you group it, it could refer to sexual impropriety, or monetary exploitation
Malakos - Soft, excess, luxury → again, Paul was probably referring to finances
Chapter 30 - Christians and the Cosmos: Revelation
Jesus never ended up returning in his disciples lifetimes, therefore texts were modified to redact/revise these claims
The Gospel of John, the latest Gospel, has no claims about the coming of the Kingdom of God
Chapter 1 - Narrates the vision of Christ John just had
Prophet John of the late 1st century
Chapter 2 - Description of the present situation of Churches today (Asia Minor)
Chapters 4- 22 - Record of his visions of the end of time
John is brought up into heaven to a throne room with 24 elder angels in thrones surrounding a figure (God) in the throne
Figure is holding a scroll with 7 seals that can only be broken by 'the lamb' → Christ
As each scroll is broken, a major catastrophe strikes earth
6th seal turns the sun black, the moon red, and the stars fall from the sky
7th seal leads to a period of silence followed by 7 more disasters
7 angels blow 7 trumpets invoking each new disaster
7th trumpet ushers in the anti-christ and his false prophets on earth
+7 more angels with bowls of God’s wrath
The End comes with the destruction of the great “Whore of Babylon”
The city that persecuted the saints
If Revelation is interpretted as propaganda → codeword for Rome
Fall of the city leads to the battle of Christ and his heavenly armies vs. the forces of the antichrist
Jesus rocks them → throws them into a pit of sulfur for eternal suffering, Satan is imprisoned in a bottomless pit
Christ and the Saints rule on earth for 1,000 years
Devil returns to lead some nations astray
THEN comes the final judgement
Dead are raised and rewarded for their deeds or condemned for their alignment with the antichrist
Hades and death itself and the devil are thrown into a lake
New heaven on earth by God for his people
New Jerusalem with pearly gates where Christ reigns forever descends
No suffering, evil, death, righteous dwell with him forever
Revelation’s supernatural tone vindicates its supernatural character
Alternatively, it can be viewed as a cryptic piece of propaganda urging persecuted Christians to resist Roman social constructs
Apocalypticism - Judeo-Christian worldview that contends that there are 2 components of reality: good and evil → everything falls into one of these two categories
Present age controlled by evil
God will come to bring the good era through judgement
Daniel - 165 B.C.E. - First Jewish Apocalypse → creates the Genre
Daniel lived in 6th century B.C.E., but the book wasn’t around for 400 more years, so no wonder his predictions about the future were right
Most likely written during the Maccabean Revolt when Jews were being attacked by the Syrians → to give hope in a dark period
Uses past history to give authority to legitimate predictions by writing under an old old authors name
Marked by themes of God coming to destroy evil
Usually 1st person narratives of their revelation
2 main categories:
Heavenly - A prophet is taken up to heaven and given a tour full of symbols: earth reflects a shadow of reality that exists in heaven
Historical sketches - The author has a symbolic vision of the future through a divine mediator
Almost all ancient Apocalypses use a pseudonym of a famous religious figure
Writing under OLD prophets/figures to “predict” things that already happened to give credence to their current predictions
Characteristics of Apocalyptic Texts
Bizarre symbolic visions - highly mystical, not straightforward descriptions, confusing even to the author himself requiring the mediation of the vision by the divine figure
Violent repetitions - redundant, interrupting repetitions of key points
Motivational Function - “God will save you and defeat evil” meant to provide hope to the people suffering
Revelation is unique in that it is not pseudonymous, just “John” which was as common a name then as it is now. Not John the Baptist, or John Son of Zebedee, just John
Nonetheless, barred from the canon for centuries do to its attribution to John of Zebedee → gnosticism.
They are definitely not the same author though → evident through the theological differences
Gospel of John has no concern with the “end” and highly disparate writing styles
John refers to the Apostles in the throne room, but does not mention seeing himself
Historians think that parts of Revelation were written in the 60s, after Nero
Probably not completed until !90, under Domitian
“Babylon” refers to Rome as the chief political enemy of God
Discusses martyrdom which was a late 1st/early 2nd century phenomenon
Number of the beast : using Gematria
Some greek manuscripts write 616 instead of 666
Nero in Hebrew = “Neron” = 666, without the additional n “nero” = 616
Shepherd of Hermas - 2nd century not pseudonymous either
Part of the canon in some New Testament transcripts
Removed because it wasn’t old enough according to the proto-orthodoxy
Muratorian Fragment - Sontains the dismissal of the Shepherd of Hermas
Does not mention Hebrews, James, 1,2 Peter, or John
Accepts the rest of the Canon AND the “Wisdom of Solomon”, “Apocalypse of Peter” though
Condemns forgeries attributed to Marcion by Paul
5 parables, 12 mandates, 10 parables
Driven by ethical concern, contends that a 2nd repentance is possible
Apocalypse of Peter - Pseudonymous, found in Arabic and Coptic → Nag Hammadi
Accepted as canon by many in the 2nd, 3rd centuries
Travels through heaven and Hell → inspired the Divine Comedy!
To avoid eternal damnation depicted in hell, don’t sin
Chapter 31 - Revelation: 144,000 Male Virgins, Professor Lynn Huber
John is speaking to a male audience, calling them to be the best men they can be by offering an alternative image of masculinity
'The Slaughtered Lamb' directly challenges the Roman paradigm of gender
Greek “dulas” = everywhere else in Greek Lit. it’s translated to mean “slave”
Because of American history of slave language, the New Testament translations get switched to “servant”
“Revelation” is linguistically similar to the word describing “lifting of the veil” at a wedding
John is very visual, commands the audience to look at things with him
Removed from NRSV as it interrupts the flow, but in King James etc. John says “Behold”
Written in Asia Minor, 65-90 C.E.
Asia Minor is more obedient to Rome than, say, Judea → love the imperial cult because they’re distanced from the persecutions closer to Rome
Emperors described as God-kings while they were alive, someone in Rome would have thought this absurd
“Providence has not yet set in motion grace for mankind through Augustus, whose benevolence surpasses all” --Asia Minor leaders
Imperial cult viewed Augustus as a savior, Council in Asia Minor adjusted calendar to center on his birthday → BIG DEAL
TIME HAS CHANGED TO REFLECT AUGUSTUS’S GREATNESS → the whole empire will know about him, they want him to know
Massive statues, huge cult worship surrounding Roman emperors
Rev Chapter 4 - describes “one who sits on the throne” and 24 other thrones seating elders who are loudly worshipping the central figure → laying their own crowns
Challenging the Roman perception of their caesars, Rev begs the question “who rules the world”[not Nero/Domitian]
Takes it a step further, emperors are evil → embodiments of Satan
John’s audience really likes the Romans … his text “lifts the veil” on the evil of the imperial cult
Roman culture heavily depicted the ‘ideal man’ and ideal masculinity
They believed that everyone is potentially male, females just weren’t good/warm/external enough
The way you become a man requires exerting your outward expressions of power/masculinity on others
Inability to do so: born a woman, slave, low born, etc. → makes it harder to achieve perfect masculinity
One of the places you could augment your virtue was the Gymnasium/bath house → especially in Asia Minor
Sites of education, not just P.E.
Where you became a MAN
Usually decorated near the entrance w/their virtues and the prizes you can win by dominating in your field → strive for laurels
Things that compromise manliness
Being a woman
Being penetrated
Not being married with children → PUSHED Roman values
Revelation challenges the idea that: you need to be a Roman man who makes more Roman men
Say no! That’s the system of “The Beast”
Rev Chapter 2 - Jesus addressing the 7 churches of Asia Minor, the good and the bad using the same, familiar Gymnasium language: “The Son of Man promises salvation to those who are victorious” → Victory in Greek = “Nike”
In Revelation, the image of success is “following the slaughtered lamb”
Those who follow the lamb are 144,000 male virgins
The lamb is slaughtered, but the lamb is also the “Lion of Juda”
Uses the same Roman language to identify the manly man of the story, but then tells a story that is completely contradictory to Roman culture
Parthenois - Girl who is about to get married → implied virginity, but not explicit
But they are about to get married to Christ
“Don’t get married to have babies, reject the Roman system of masculinity”
The Purpose of Revevelation:
Demand devotion to God
Cultivating the dominant culture in the context of the Throne Room
Paraprosdokian - Flipping the Roman family ideal and sexual paradigm
Rough Timelines/Dates
165 B.C.E. - Daniel authored as the first apocalypse
4 B.C.E. - Jesus' Birth
30-33 C.E. Death of Jesus
50s - Paul writes
60-65 C.E. - Gospel of Mark
67 C.E. - Jewish revolts in response to Persecution at the hand of Nero
70 C.E. - Temple destroyed → Roman backlash for Jewish occupation of Israel
80-85 C.E. - Matthew and Luke written
90 C.E. - Gospel of John written
90-95 C.E. - Acts of the Apostles, Revelation published
End of 1st century - Jesus words considered scripture → Law
Beginning of 2nd century - Apostles’ words carry similar authority, Pastoral and Deutero-Pauline epistles authored/li>
Mid 2nd century - Marcionite Canon
Late 2nd century - Irenaeus’s Canon
Early 3rd century - Origen’s Canon
312 C.E. - Constantine makes Christianity the official religion of the Roman empire
325 C.E. - Council of Nicea called to address the diversity of the Early Church → Produced the Nicene Creed
327 C.E. - Eusebius’s Canon (categorization of books based on their orthodoxy and authorship)
367 C.E. - Athanasius’s Canon → First modern Canon Established by Proto-orthodoxy

The man struggled with death, and the adolescent struggled with despair, which is close to death.

He was conservative in his politics but liberally generous when it came to sharing himself...If the measure of a man is what he leaves behind, his legacy will
carry on with a family that amplifies the best he gave to the world.

SACRIFICE
          He woke up the next morning because the moment was structured such that he had to do so --KV
  Excess
    It accretes around you
      discarding part of the self for the sake of the whole
        tantamount to the discovery of the concept of the future in that it is necessary to ensure the security of the future.
        what is the maximally correct sacrifice?
        what is the upper limit with regard to how your life might lay itself out?
            the passion of Christ constitutes the archetypal limit of sacrifice.

    Do not be naive in your motivation to move forward
      if you are naive and you move forward -- well... there's no courage in that

      [COURAGE]
        but to be aware... and to still decide to move forward into the unknown.  that is courageous
          people don't get less afraid, they get braver
            the voluntary subjection to challenge is the pinnacle of progression within human existence

      [THE STRANGE AND THE UNKNOWN]
        non naive risks give substantial meaning to the otherwise fatal and miserable life

        "I will make you known in the land of the stranger" --Hebrews 11:9

            VOLITION    APPROACH    CHALLENGE
            FEAR        WITHDRAWAL  DEFENSE

          [THE LAND OF THE STRANGER]
          to be Master of the the strange and unknown, the land of the stranger. home.
            Prove yourself useful -- keep thine covenant

          "In no uncertain terms, [the stranger] was told that he was welcome to bathe, welcome to the food,
          and then welcome to leave.  These instructions were delivered in a slurred jumble as Pietro wobbled
          within the doorway." --Neff

          Be not inhospitable to the stranger.  Retreating to the familiarity of vice in the face of him is to
            search in the dark for a palliation.

          "The man was blind drunk, his eyes bloodshot from alcohol and weeping."

          It is to run.

          [SACRIFICE]
          The token of the covenant must be grave. must be serious.
            to catalyze your identity through pain. through suffering.
              the pain is necessary to establish the memory that is etched upon you.

          Pain is threat is unforgettability
            commitment is predicated on dramatic seriousness
              it's not nothing


          something has to be given up
                        things you are vs. things you own.
                which is the more dramatic sacrifice

          because it is dramatic to make a sacrifice
            it has to be bloody; serious; painful.

            "Stop smoking or you'll die!"

          we can't make that "real" enough to be serious

                flesh must be cast away so that the spirit may be made strong

                to augment your identity






                        SCRATCHES






                Oh, but to be weak.
                    Just as readily as progression,
                      So, too, does escape beckon.

                  Lustful is the allure of ignorance.
                    Charming is the embrace of inoculation from
                      the crack of the world's whip.

                  To secure the protective draught of cowardice.
                  To readily turn towards irresponsibility
                    in the face of the stranger.
                  To avoid foreign lands.
                  To hide from that which you are afraid.
                  To relish the carefree nature of insobriety.
                  To deny the call.
                  To forego the responsibility.
                  To reject the adventure that is
                    the encounter with the stranger.
                  To seek shelter within Sodom.
                  To be familiar with Lot.
                  To turn to הנחש בגן.
                  To block the רוח נשימה.

                  To run.







    "It is an emotional thing. It joggles you out of the standardism of everyday life,
    out of everything being the same.  It yanks you out of your body and your mind and
    throws you against the wall.  I have the feeling that it is a form of suicide where
    you're allowed to return to life and begin all over the next day.  It's like killing
    yourself, and then you're reborn.  I guess I've lived about ten or fifteen thousand
    lives now." --Burkowski







        willful negligence of one's moral obligations is antithetical to courage
          it is neither rewarded nor admonished
            it is but chaff in the winds of urgency

            No.  It is to be reprimanded.  Neutrality does not entail folding to the urge of ease.

            to be swept away by the stranger

        it is often aligned with cowardice rather than negligence.

        Heaven’s face doth glow
        O’er this solidity and compound mass
        With heated visage, as against the doom,
        Is thought-sick at the act.  --Hamlet

        [A TERRITORY OF ETHICS VIA INJUNCTION OF HERITAGE]

          ensuring that they know how to take their place

          IDEALS are TRANSCENDENT, they are manifest through potential



          pursuit of that ideal is predicated by the eternal
            while you are not obligated to personify the eternal ideals, there are damn good reasons to try
            if you make the serious sacrifice, the future people who will benefit from it will serve as the judges of that sacrifice

                  including yourself
  Those who do not participate in the making of sacrifice shall be cut off from the community





    Have to sacrifice the part for the sake of the whole
    if the monkey cannot let go - cut it off from the community
      you seriously have to let go, because there is NOTHING more important than moving forward - immediately.

      [SOCRATES TRIAL]

        with 6 months to escape his upcoming trial which would undoubtedly result in his execution,
        Socrates adhered to the advice of the voice in his head which, although never providing the right answer,
        would consistently tell him what not to do.  He did not plan to evade the trial, or even plan his defense
        for the case which would be leveraged against him.
            ~The ideal becomes the judge because it is ABOVE you.
                It tells you what is useless about you so that you can shed the imperfection and formulate a new, HIGHER you
                  One which approaches the archetypal limit of sacrifice.  A Christ figure of personality.

        "If I could be who I need to be, what would that look like?"

        Shape yourself evermore precisely to withstand the trials of life.

        How do you treat the strange - that which is not you.
        do you wish to be comfortable with that which you already are, or that which you do not know.
        do you want to be that person which can master the strange?
        you will not know the stranger when you encounter him; everyone presents themselves in the way they reveal themselves to you

        every man is uniformly strange to the other
        society's foundation lies upon the implicit supposition that you have transcendent respect within the law.
              intrinsic value within the natural law

        operation of a lawful society is derived from the biblical nature of the speaking forth of being
          by ourselves in relation to each other --even to vicious criminals--
            no man is subject to a punishment which he has not yet earned.

        Abraham, Master of the Stranger, Sojourn of the Unknown, Father of Nations
          he who is vastly imperfect, who is with sin,
          he who is without child,
          he who maketh a covenant to the ideal, the transcendent, the future judge,
          he who sheds that which obstructs his progression for the sake of the direly immediate progression,
          he who makes that necessary sacrifice.
              that necessary sacrifice.
          he who enters into the land of the stranger,
          he who welcomes them, even though he is by no means restricted to that reaction,
          he who courageously evokes the best of them,
          he who beckons them to step forward,
          he who takes them into his house,
          he who fathers many,
          he who seeks the truth,
          he who is this harbinger of salvation.



The world lost a great man this week with the passing of my friend
Sean Murphy. The days are little less bright, there’s a little less
laughter and a little less twinkle around us without him.


I highly doubt there was ever a person who met Sean who didn’t like
him almost immediately.  I certainly felt that way when we first
met in January of 1990, in the U.S. Capitol building.  He was a
young staffer for Sen. Hank Brown and I was taking a semester off
from college to do an internship with Rep. Joel Hefley – two
Colorado lawmakers whose staffs frequently mixed. He lived a few
blocks away and, being relative strangers in a strange town with
big dreams but little means, we spent hours and hours playing cards
and plotting our eventual takeover of the world.  We bonded over
Boulder, the Buffs, politics and our shared experience of growing
up in small-town Colorado.


I couldn’t have foreseen then just how much that friendship would
impact the course of my life.  If it wasn’t for Sean’s gracious
offer of a couch to crash on, I might not have packed up my car
after finishing school and headed to Washington.


He was my only friend on the east coast, let alone the city, and
he took me in and helped me get on my feet, giving me tips about
potential jobs and helping me make connections.


But Sean gave me more than a place to stay – he introduced me to the
love of my life, my future wife, Lisa Ververs.  I’ll never forget
going to his apartment immediately after our first date to tell him
I had met the woman I was going to marry – or his happiness for us
having found each other.


Lisa and I were thrilled to have him as a groomsman in our wedding
and have remained thankful for his friendship over the nearly 25 years
since. We were lucky enough to stay close to Sean when he moved to
Colorado and, especially, when he and his family came back to Virginia.


The essence of Sean never changed – he loved life and everything that
came with it. He was forever adventurous, curious and fundamentally
positive.  He was conservative in his politics but liberally generous
when it came to sharing himself.  And man did he love to laugh – and
laugh, and laugh and laugh.


And he loved to love, especially his family.  Sean never bragged about
himself or his professional success when we talked, saving all of his
boasting for the family he so cherished and adored, and rightfully so.
If the measure of a man is what he leaves behind, Sean’s legacy will
carry on with a family that amplifies the best he gave to the world.


He loved his dear wife, Johanna, with a profound devotion.  She brought
out the absolute best in him and he was happy and content with her by
his side.  His love for her was surpassed perhaps only by that he had
for his sons, Jack, Peter and Charlie.  He was deeply proud of the
young men they have become and believed their futures to be limitless.


By any metric, he and Johanna have raised three impressive young men
who already serve as a testament to their high values and deep faith.
It’s been a privilege to be witness to their lives and we are excited
to watch as they continue to grow and thrive.


Sean and I called one another by a lot of names over the years (many
of them unprintable), but the most important was “brother,” and I’m
just one of a multitude who considered him family -- because he made
everyone feel like they were a part of his. For nearly 30 years, I’ve
considered him part of mine as well.  I’ll always remember Christmas
Eve in 1991, when I was alone in Washington with nothing to do. Sean
invited me to spend the evening with him and we trudged through snowy
streets to attend midnight Mass at St. Matthews Cathedral.  I wasn’t
yet a Catholic at the time but I was grateful for the gesture and his
company.


It is tempting to be angry at the loss of someone who brought so much
happiness into the world, to shake our fists and demand to know how
God could take him away. I prefer to be thankful to God for sharing
such a gift at all, even if the time was too short.  The lives of
anyone who knew Sean are far richer for it.


I’ll forever remember our friendship -- the untold hands of hearts
and spades that we played, the hours of political gossip and debate,
the road trip adventures, the dinners and holidays our families
shared and, of course, all the laughs we had together.


I just wish I could have said goodbye.  Love ya, brotha.
-Vaughn Ververs


Thank you, Mr. Speaker.


Mr. Speaker, the House is often described as a family, but it's a lot
bigger than 435 members. Our extended family, of course, includes the
staff of the House, and the staff of each and every member. The Capitol
police that do such an extraordinary job of protecting all of us. The
maintenance crews that make sure the facilities function and are open
to the public. And frankly all those others who make the House of
Representatives a very special place.


I rise today, Mr. Speaker, to report what many of you already know.
The loss of a member of that extended family, my longtime Chief of
Staff. Sean Patrick Murphy. Sean’s been a professional associate and
friend of mine for 19 years. He was my Chief of Staff for 11 years.
And, frankly, we both believed he would be the last Chief of Staff I
would ever have. Sean Patrick Murphy left us unexpectedly in February.


He had based his life on three things. His faith, his family, and his
friends. Those people who were privileged to know Sean know that he was
a very devout Catholic and his faith was not something that was casual
to him. It was something that he lived each and every day. And carried
out in each and every relationship he had. Nothing was more important
after his faith than his family.


Sean Murphy was the consummate husband and father. He loved his family.
And he lived a life of total dedication to them. His wife, Johannah, his
sons [John] Patrick, Peter, and Charlie were fixtures that we all heard
about in our office each and every day. Particularly the boys. Because
there would always be a funny story about what they happened to be
doing at any given moment. And Sean worked hard so Johannah could stay
home and homeschool those three children. So they were an extraordinarily
close group. And finally, there were Sean’s friends.


No one had more, no one, frankly, held his friends longer, and no one
treasured them more than Sean. And because of that, if you happened
to attend his funeral, you saw over 2,000 family and friends show up
for to the remember this extraordinary man. As a person, Sean had all
the wit, all the wisdom, all the decency of the Irish. He was a natural
leader and a loyal colleague. People followed him because they trusted
him. He was fair, he was decent, he was selfless. He always put others
first. And if you spent a day with Sean Murphy, you were going to laugh.
He made people laugh, partly, by laughing at himself. In all the years
I knew him, in all the many capacities we dealt together, I never had
one other person come and complain to me about Sean. No constituent,
no fellow staff member, no lobbyist, no member of another office. All
of them thought they were his best friend. Now he was pretty good at
that and would give you a pretty good opinion later of whether they
were really a friend or not. Everybody who knew him liked him and
everybody believed he’d liked them back.


Sean’s lifelong profession, and really it began when he was quite
young, was his passion for politics. He took it first as a volunteer
and it did become the manner in which he lived his life. Now, his
gentleman nature -- hid an extraordinarily competitive personal spirit.
Politics, I like to say, is an adult team sport and Sean played it
exceptionally well. He was astute in his judgment about people and
about politics. And in all the many issues we discussed, over many
years, both in terms of dealing with political campaigns and dealing
with politics of the House itself, both on the floor and in our
conference, I never got a piece of bad advice from Sean.


But with Sean, politics always had a purpose. And that purpose was
always to achieve some greater good, some more important goal. He wasn't
just good at winning. He was good at governing. He frankly never sold out.
He had plenty of opportunities to go and make a lot more money than I
could have ever paid him. But he worked for principle. He always put his
country and his party and his people above anything that might benefit
himself. And he believed in the things that he worked for. And he worked
to make a difference in this country each and every day. Frankly, he
cherished this institution above all else. He enjoyed not only the
politics but those rare moments of drama when great things happen on
the floor of the House. And he made sure that any member he worked for,
and I wasn't the only one, had an opportunity to impact those events,
thanks to his good advice, thanks to the wonderful staff that he built
and created, and thanks to his shrewd strategy.


All of us who knew him believe he left us far too soon but that's pretty
presumptive, Mr. Speaker. Who are any of us to say something like that?
God chooses the time that we come and the time that we go. How can you
be bitter when your friend went to his bed innocent and untroubled and
woke up in heaven with our Lord and savior. But, God does allow us to
miss him, and miss him we all will. He'll be missed as a husband and a
father and a friend. He blessed all of us with his life and for me in
particular, Mr. Speaker, I will miss him for all my days. With that,
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.


































































































I remember the day he walked into the office and saw your mother.

He said, "That's the woman I'm going to marry.



    "Living is easy with eyes closed." --Strawberry Fields Forever

          life is an adventure because it is an ongoing encounter with the strange
            life might hit you with something; make you change your perspective
            studies might matter more.  or matter less.
            family is all that matters
            the truth will present itself in the absence of the luxuries you may enjoyed previously
            family is all that matters
        life is an adventure because it is dangerous; it is not easy.

        No one else can tell your stories.
          The land of the strangers is an infinite vista of things to be learned
            befriend that which you do not understand

        How do you act in the face of the stranger?
          "When you do something to the least of people, you do it to me" --Matthew 25:40
            the sacrifice to the future judge

      Be there for the good that can be done between you.
      The growing puppy does not get petted, but they absorb the rejection.
        they get what they evoke, and that's not necessarily their fault.

      But that doesn't matter.......

      If it happens 3 times it's you.  Or the rest of the world, but better that it be you,
        because you can't change the rest of the world.

          So do as thou has sent.  (actually do it)

          "Be not forgetful to entertain strangers"   --Hebrews 13:2

          he stands at the door and knocks

          "behold, I stand at the door and knock"     --Revelation 3:20

          do not shy from the opportunity to welcome the strange

    to truly want something is to be willing to sacrifice everything for it.
                  God only knows what will happen if you do.

    [Existentialism] places a huge weight on self-responsibility due to the religious sub-structures that bore it.

      The ambiguity of Cain's sacrifice.
        To live authentically in the face of misery and challenge
        only you can forego the challenge.
        No one can take it away.
        You may forego it, but that is to fail
          for you have not tried

        You may still fail if you make the necessary sacrifice
              it may not be good enough

            TO GIVE EVERYTHING AND NOT SUCCEED

        but that does not strip away the necessity of opening the door to the stranger
            to destiny

        Everyone can hypothesize a better self.
        Everyone has the capacity to posit a better version of themselves.
        And it is everything to posit an ideal and to move forward.
        To posit the ultimate ideal is the fundamental basis of a religious awareness.
          of progression

Character

  "Existimatione et recordatione genitoris mei ad verecundiam et animum viro dignum excitari debeo."

  You were given life;  It is your inherent obligation to reflect that gift.

            In the silence of the night, I looked up and saw my father, sobbing

  Sorting one's self is not a retreat from the pressures and anxieties of life,
    but a confrontation of those burdens.
      It takes courage.

  But to transfer that burden.  To trap another.

            "When a father gives to his son, both laugh;
                  when a son gives to his father, both cry."  --The Secret of Psalm 46

  To make that effort to resolve that which threatens one's comfort.
      One's safety.

  To be vulnerable.


To run.




While the English language offers a plethora of satisfactory terms with which to describe any
conceivable notion—abstract, physical or otherwise— and while, in my opinion, many of the most
premium, scholarly words find their origins in the roots of the ancient Roman language,
Modernist author William Faulkner's quotation,
"You cannot swim for new horizons until you have courage to lose sight of the shore,”
strikes me, for several reasons stemming from the implied fact that truth can be discovered through
perseverance towards a goal, even if that goal is not yet clear, as long as the individual or group
in question shares that common vision for revealing the objective truth of any given matter and is
willing to overcome the inevitable obstacles which, in circumstances involving quests for the most
difficult and trying inquiries, individuals with the knowledge that their venture will likely test
the very core of their person, challenging their understanding of their own motivations and beliefs,
will impede their progress on the journey to truth and success, whereas a less buoyant group or
individual might sink beneath the weight of the impending tides of strife, caving to the whispers
invoking surrender across the enigmatic ocean of indeterminate struggle, but nevertheless exhibit
superior fortitude and ultimately prevail over the gauntlets presented to them, whether those trials
concern determining the meaning of life, or a simpler, but equally nebulous and philosophical audit,
such as specifying an individual's favorite word and why, as perhaps the most appropriate platitude
by which my favorite word, "palaver," can be applied.

  "Wallowing in negativity - it is corrosive to the character." --J. Hughes



  "There was something terrible in me sometimes at night I could see it grinning at me
        I could see it through the grinning at me through their faces it's gone now and I'm sick"

  It is not a retreat.

  "Do you want me to say it do you think that if I say it it wont be"

  Life might hit you with something; make you change you perspective...

  "and he every man is the arbiter of his own virtues whether or not you

  The last note sounded.

  To confront that which makes you uncomfortable.
              that which threatens your safety.
              that which is dangerous.
              that which is foreign.
              that which is out of sight of the shore.
              that which is life.





And Not To Run.









Volition, Responsibility


  I thought that I knew about what it meant to be responsible,
    for I had not yet appreciated the luxuries afforded me.

  Years later, I still thought I knew.

  I did not.

  I still do not.



    Service within a community is the cornerstone of civilization.
    When individuals within society recognize that their concerted
    efforts tangibly improve the lives of those around them, and then
    take that time to make the difference voluntarily, a liminal transition
    from mere coexistence to communal thriving takes place.  While the
    ideological concept of service is widely supported, the actual
    participation in that principle of helping others often and
    unfortunately fails to manifest in everyone’s day-to-day lives.



  But, ... not responsible.

  "Every one is really responsible to all men for all men and for everything.” ―-Dostoevsky

  ...but better that it be you,
    because you can't change the rest of the world...

    Suffering, Sacrifice, and Adversity.


    They all share a common similarity in the sense that their impact on our lives can be understood
    through our approach towards experiencing them.  The reason why I’m choosing to dwell on these subjects
    is that I believe that the volition that defines our approach to these otherwise unpleasant realities
    determines how we make it out the other side.  “That’s sort of obtuse and cumbersome of you"


              Jim Gaffigan will be present and heckling.

    Suffering unifies, strengthens, and reveals value that may have been overlooked.
      life might hit you with something; make you change your perspective
            For better,
              Or for worse.

    Sacrifice Septimus Warren Smith and the ground which rose up to meet him.

    Adversity It’s not worth it if it wasn’t challenging.

    it is easier to hide from these defining realities of human existence.
    it is easier to be incoherent than it is to have an articulate plan.
    it is easier to run.

    You must prepare.

    "For if people do these things when the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?" --Luke 23:31

    You must sacrifice when it is easy, so you are acquainted with loss when it is not.


      "If not the face of men,
      The sufferance of our souls, the time’s abuse—
      If these be motives weak, break off betimes,
      And every man hence to his idle bed." --Brutus


    [Gratitude]



    Perhaps the easiest and most rewarding initiative any and every individual is capable of performing is a simple
    act of gratitude.  Expressing thanks towards another for some action, menial or tremendous, that they have
    undertaken, even if it does not directly benefit oneself, is an exceedingly easy and tangible act of gratitude.
    While a simple "thanks" for trivial, but courteous, gestures is still deserving of an exchange of acknowledgement
    --one that does not even require verbal communication: a nod of the head, a smile, a wave.  Effortless, to the
    point that these are involuntary reactions to any decent mannered soul-- the genuine thanks that we often feel
    towards each other is all too rarely articulated.  Day after day after day, for years, do we neglect to share
    our appreciation for those around us, until such actions are taken for granted.  Reduced from a luxury which is
    indexed at every junction, to just another commodity or service that is so familiar that we fail to account for
    its source.  More importantly, we fail to account for the labor, the effort, the time, the sweat, the stress,
    and the burden that predicated our appreciation of that good which we might not even appreciate unless it was
    stripped away.  The colloquial example of the common-place waste bin comes to mind as one such "invention" that
    we take for granted.  This is not to imply that we should orient ourselves around praising every host who provides
    their guests with a receptacle with which to dispose of their garbage; rather we ought to recognize how fortunate
    we are to benefit from those efforts to streamline our lives.  We should graciously thank those who feed,
    shelter, provide for, teach, and love us.  And yet, those responsible for the aforementioned litany of gestures
    we frequently take for granted, that is to say: our family; may not receive our verbal appreciation because
    of how mundane so many of gestures are too our daily lives.  It is all too easy to take those gestures for granted.
    It is all too easy to take those people for granted.  Until you are scrambling to throw away a festering mass of
    soiled napkins, you may not truly appreciate your trashcan.




"Thank You"


    "So let high-sighted tyranny range on
    Till each man drop by lottery. But if these--
    As I am sure they do--bear fire enough
    To kindle cowards and steel with valor
    The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,
    What need we any spur but our own cause
    To prick us to redress?"

    Do better.  Approach the transcendent ideal because it is the best cause.
      Let it prick thee to redress.
        Refute the tyranny of thine own habits.
          Do not drop by the lottery; prove thine self to be worthy of the empire.
            Owe it to yourself.  Out Of obligation,

            Of the strange land.

    So be thankful for that which has been afforded to you.
      Do not wait for his absence before you go to thank him.
        Do not withhold your gratitude.

        It is effortless.

        Cherish the time that you share.

        Act upon the generosity which your are obligated to reciprocate.


    "If thou shouldst live three thousand years, or as many myriads, yet remember this, that no man loses any
    other life than which he now lives; and that he now lives no other life than what he is parting with, every instant.
    The longest life, and the shortest, come to one effect: since the present time is equal to all.  And for the same
    reason, what is parted with, is only a moment.  No man at death parts with, or, is deprived of, what is either past
    or future.  For how can one take from a man what he hath not?  We should also remember these things, first, That all
    things which have happened in the continued revolutions from eternity, are the same kind with what we behold: And 'tis
    of little consequence, whether a man beholds the same things for an hundred years, or an infinite duration.  Again
    that the longest and shortest lives have an equal loss at Death."

    Life is an adventure.

    "Surviving fame is but oblivion; . . . philosophy alone can accompany us in our future progress."

    Life is dangerous.

    "Expect death with calm satisfaction . . . It is natural, and nothing natural can be evil."

    Life is a gift.

        --Book II of the Meditations of Emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus

    [Uncertainty]

    Do no romanticize that which troubles you.

    To construe it in such a way which glorifies its strength over you, or your inability to handle it
      is a rejection of your responsibilities --for they are not singular-- to temper and resist its grasp over you.
    It is worse than conceding defeat;
      it is an embrace of your submission to it whilst delaying your accountability towards yourself.

    It is not courageous

    "Conversely, the silence emanating from his mother is equally troubling in its distinctly morose disposition.
    She is not formidable in the sense that her husband was, and that absence of intimidation is reflected in

    which ought to compose a noble, respectful, and proud succession." --Wilmington

    "You're drunk..."


    Billy covered his head with his blanket again. He always covered his head when his
    mother came to see him in the mental ward -always got much sicker until she went away.
    It wasn't that she was ugly, or had bad breath or a bad personality. She was a perfectly
    nice, standard-issue, brown-haired, white woman with a high-school education.

    She upset Billy simply by being his mother. She made him feel embarrassed and
    ungrateful and weak because she had gone to so much trouble to give him life, and to
    keep that life going, and Billy didn’t really like life at all.

    And then Billy's mother came back from the ladies' room, sat down on a chair between
    Billy's and Rosewater's bed. Rosewater greeted her with melodious warmth, asked how
    she was today. He seemed delighted to hear that she was fine. He was experimenting with
    being ardently sympathetic with everybody he met. He thought that might make the
    world a slightly more pleasant place to live in. He called Billy's mother 'dear.' He was
    experimenting with calling everybody 'dear.'

    'Some day' she promised Rosewater, 'I'm going to come in here, and Billy is going to
    uncover his head, and do you know what he's going to say?'

    'What's he going to say, dear?'

    'He's going to say, 'Hello, Mom," and he's going to smile. He's going to say, 'Gee, it's
    good to see you, Mom. How have you been?"'

    'Today could be the day.’

    'Every night I pray.'

    'That's a good thing to do.’

    'People would be surprised if they knew how much in this world was due to prayers.'

    'You never said a truer word, dear.’

    'Does your mother come to see you often?'

    'My mother is dead,' said Rosewater. So it goes.

    'I'm sorry.'

    'At least she had a happy life as long as it lasted.’

    'That's a consolation, anyway.'

    'Yes.'

    'Billy's father is dead, you know, said Billy's mother. So it goes.

    'A boy needs a father.’

    man so full of loving echoes." -- Vonnegut

"Will To Power Carry On" : Reticence of the Mind

  From the supplicant of transcendent value comes that which enables it own conscription to downfall.

  To build up a belief system around ideals.  Robust, but flawed.

  Founded upon such rudimentary "truths" --the aberrated excuse for teleology--
    And then to have that integral belief shattered.

    Life might hit you with something; make you change your perspective

    make you change your mind.  About the fundamental composition bound so intimately to one's identity.
      The most verifiable truths
        Nothing can be known then.

        nihilism

    "The well-being of the universe demands the devotion of the individual" - On the Decline of Cosmological Value


"But as soon as man finds out how that world is fabricated solely from psychological needs, and how he has absolutely
    no right to it, the last form of nihilism comes into being; it includes disbelief in any metaphysical world and forbids
    itself any belief in a true world"



    In disproving to one's self, the truth of Christianic values previously regarded as infallible, one can dissuade themselves from reality itself.

    If those values are fully developed, they will experience a fall from the height of the fulfillment to utter despair.

    The same pattern of devolution into ambiguity and cynicism holds true about any blow incurred to the very epicenter of one's philosophic identity.

    However, the bold & brash nature of the Christianic values espoused not only by the Catholic Church, but by Western culture as whole,
      phenomenologically abolishes all claims towards nihilistic, fasces constructs whose asymptotically naive
        philosophy crumbles before the sanctity of the pinnacle of that religious order by which it is so destroyed.

      "I contemplate the moment in the garden [of Eden].  The idea of allowing your own crucifixion."

      Such a magnitude of sacrifice, to take a mere fraction of the philosophy, is un-matched by any other
        ideologically motivated belief system.


      "He sat just there, in the front left, towards the middle, every Sunday.
      And every Sunday he received.  I have no inhibitions towards the status of his future."


      That is why it is so significant to one's understanding of what sacrifice,
        salvation, and fulfillment mean with respect to the maximum capacity
          of his own mortal experience."

      Nietzsche believed that the downfall of religion ushered in a new wave of agnostic industrialism
        founded on the basis of rationalism; and he was terrified of the repercussions of a secular society that was
          devoid of the unifying aspects of a devout society, regardless of their dogmatic propositions.


      In the vacuum devoid of religious unification and social bolstering, such ideologies as communism and
        right wing radicalism were ushered in during the 20th century, and Nietzsche's prediction came to fruition.


      Therefore it is with the utmost fervor that this [whatever this shall be called] be oriented around.  --PXM






"All the values by means of which we have tried so far to render the world estimable for ourselves and which
    then proved inapplicable and therefore devaluated the world --all these values are, psychologically considered,
    the results of certain perspectives of utility, designed to maintain and increase human constructs of domination--
    and they have been falsely projected into the essence of things."



    Attempts to separate morality from God leads to nihilism, as without the backbone of presupposed objective truth
      espoused by the Christianic God, "Those who have abandoned God cling that much more firmly to the faith in morality."

    A morality predicated on what?  Denial of the existence of the metaphysical world?  Good luck, bucko.

    Ensnared by ignorance -- this is not what he wrote.

    "One still hopes to get along with a moralism without religious background: but that necessarily leads to nihilism.
    -- In religion the constraint is lacking to consider ourselves as value positing."

    In the absence of God, one's own conscience steps forward.

    In the face of the infinite, to posit one's one moral structure is the boldest, and most irrational of actions to
      be taken.  Albeit it understandable in the face of the nihilistic void, such a gesture requires a degree of
        ignorance or, contra-positively, arrogant confidence that defies the discoveries and belief systems which dominated
          the preceding two millennia.  That is not to say that age predicts authenticity, or that it ought to be the basis
            of truth in and of itself, but that it be respected in its own right as a legitimate response to the
              experience of life, and perhaps the most logical path to embark upon of all.

    Belief is better than the pessimistic outlook which posits:

    "Human consciousness is a tragic misstep in evolution.  [That] We became too self-aware, nature created an aspect of
    nature separate from itself, [that] we are creatures that should not exist by natural law.  [That] we are things that
    labor under the illusion of having a self; an accretion of sensory, experience and feeling, programmed with total
    assurance that we are each somebody, when in fact everybody is nobody. [That] maybe the honorable thing for our species
    to do is deny our programming, stop reproducing, walk hand in hand into extinction, one last midnight - brothers and
    sisters opting out of a raw deal."

    A raw deal indeed, which neglects what is arguably the ultimate purpose of a singular human life: to establish a legacy.

    Something which transcends your own menial perception of existence.
      Something which can formulate its own perspective with regard to the tragedies of life.

      Perhaps he will adopt an attitude of resignation in the face of gross terror and impediment.

      Perhaps she will adopt an attitude of courage to embrace the unknown, personified by an attitude and
        approach towards the unknown which beckons adventure, and overcoming, no matter the challenge at hand.

      A legacy of excellence and courage.                 Ideals which ought to be striven for.

    "for what?"


"In sum, that we have a goal for which one does not hesitate to offer human sacrifices, to risk every danger,
    to take upon oneself whatever is bad and worst: the great passion."



    It is dire and immediate.

    "Reform is not a luxury, but a necessity" --Robert Gates

    Nihilism erases the necessity for Sacrifice.  For progression.  For fulfillment.


"The ways of self-narcotization. -- Deep down: not knowing whither.  Emptiness. Attempt to get over it
    by intoxication: intoxication as music; intoxication as cruelty in the tragic enjoyment of the destruction of the noblest;
    intoxication as blind enthusiasm for single human beings or ages (as hatred, etc.) -- Attempt to work blindly as an instrument
    of science: opening one's eye to the many small enjoyments; e.g. also in the quest of knowledge (modesty towards oneself);
    resignation to generalizing about oneself, a pathos; mysticism, the voluptuous enjoyment of eternal emptiness; art "for itself
    own sake" and "pure knowledge" as narcotic states of disgust with oneself; some kind or other of continual work, or of some
    stupid little fanaticism; a medley of all means, sickness owing to general immoderation (debauchery kills enjoyment)."



    If he is infatuated with an ideal and proceeds to reduce its authenticity, to romanticize it for convenience,
      and then it is struck down.  Do not be surprised when his world crumbles around the invalidity of the central belief.

    To dilute the pure and eminently superior concept of the ideal, to drag it from its hierarchical level of conceptual virtue
      to the level of primordial vice - that is to destroy not only the pureness of the struggle which thou hast entered, but to
        sully thine own understanding of the ideal --for it, in and of itself cannot be corrupted-- and to destroy the purpose of the journey.

    So do not artificially remove the obstacles which stand between you and your goal.  The goal is not only holistically important,
      but so is the sum of the parts which composed the journey which led you to its doorstep.

    An easily achievable goal --or ideal-- is far less potent than the one which you most truly desire.
      Which you most truly need.

    By imparting your own weakness upon the journey towards the end result, you misconstrue and replace the ideal itself.
      Was it not courage that you strove for?

          This is not courage, to sit idly at a desk and pound away strokes in a frenzy of intoxicated epiphanies.



     No.  It was the ideal of courage, the antithesis of nihilism and cowardice which you sought.  That is not the way.
      The path towards virtue rarely presents itself as readily as that of vice.  However, to ignore its existence is to
        forfeit the struggle before even encountering a legitimate obstacle.



    Persevere.


    Do not be like the Sophists: sitting around thinking and hypothesizing, but failing to act upon their self-proclaimed sagacity.

    Fill pages with text.  Become inflated with preponderances of what is unfolding around you.
      Life is an adventure; incomprehensible.
      Humbled or humiliated; sketches and scribbles (will cannot)* deliver you from that which is eternal.                                            this lapse in grammatical consistency personifies the voice of the narrator (me) who continues to struggle with each "chapter" that he presents.
      Be it God, be it Death -- no quantity of words holds the capacity to romanticize, to rationalize the singular truth.

    "Detached and idealistic, values, instead of dominating and guiding action, turn against action and condemn it."

    Not in the service of discounting the belief that the greatest questions of life surround morality, but in advocacy of acting them out.

      he could still turn around
    To the familiarity of the shore.

"Will To Power Succeed: Salient Effort, Sincerity, and Grit"
  June 5 10:47 AM [Success]




            "I’d like to take this opportunity to thank all of the teachers, faculty, distinguished guests
          including his Excellency Bishop , , the Most Reverend
          , , , friends, family, and most importantly of
          all: you my fellow graduates! For being here this morning.  It’s not often that a student gets the
          chance to address his classmates, his classmates’ families, and even perhaps his classmates’ extended
          families, so bear with me.  I’ll admit that I have been known to filibuster for the sake of hearing my
          own voice --in fact, I’m too afraid to turn around to see how many teachers are staring daggers at me
          right now-- but I’ll try keep this short and sweet.

            I’m going to talk about our perspective towards the obstacles that I know each of us has either
          experienced over the past four years, or will face sometime down the road in our lives.
          I believe that the volition that defines our approach to these otherwise unpleasant realities determines
          how we make it out the other side.  Now, without being too verbose and cumbersome, It is first necessary
          to recognize how blessed we all are to be sitting here, looking pretty sharp in our graduation caps,
          gowns, assorted scholastic cords, and diplomas.  Go us.

            According to the school website: “, a co-educational, college preparatory high school
          located in historic , began its proud heritage of academic excellence rooted in
          Catholic tradition in 1964.”  I wanted to unpack that description as, strangely enough, I think it’s
          an exceptional jumping off point to discuss the significance of our school and its role in our
          preparation for the next parts of our lives.

             is “College Preparatory.”  Now, whether we realize it or not,  has taught us many
          things over the past 4 years:

            We learned about the sensitivity of fire alarms,
            We learned how to cram 200 years of history into just two hours,
            We gained an acute awareness for just how long 48 minutes really lasts,
            We’ve learned about Mitochondria, Pythagoras, the Founding Fathers, literature ranging from the
              Classicists to the contemporaries.

            And we should be thankful for the opportunities afforded us to not only attend, but graduate from,
          a private school that offers such a wealth of other specialized classes to serve our outlying interests.
          Although important and necessary, academic classes serve largely as the means by which lasting and
          developmental character traits have been imparted to us.  Therefore, and perhaps most importantly of all,
          we learned about the power of community.

            I would love to explain how a litany of virtues are expressed by the the Class of 2018, but I think I’m
          only allowed to talk for about an hour, so I’m going to focus on one in particular: and that’s Courage.
          The reliably benevolent characteristic in question can be found in every encounter with any  student.
          This strength of our Class, and our school community as a whole, is predicated upon the classroom environment
          which is rooted in Catholic Tradition.

            I think it’s important to clarify that Courage has everything to do with our approach, and nothing to do with
          the object matter of the obstacle, and it comes in many forms.

            It might be trying out for a sport you’ve never played before,
            Securing the lead role in a theatrical production with no previous acting experience,
            Starting a club to develop your interests without knowing where it will take you,
            Enduring the next 56 minutes of my speech,
            Or even just opting to sacrifice 15 minutes that could be spent in the warmth of your bed in order to get
              to school early to study for a test.

            Courage doesn’t necessitate performing heroic and terrifying deeds of epic proportion in the face of danger.
          I mean it might, but it is also expressed in the mundane tasks we carry out in our day-to-day lives.
          It means having the will to try to overcome an obstacle in your life, and doing so freely.

            According to the aforementioned blurb from the website, ’s efficacy as an educational institution is
          “Rooted in Catholic Tradition.”  This is largely due to the cooperation between the teachers and faculty and
          the students to integrate our Catholic Faith into everything we do as a school.  This sense of community would
          not be possible without either side of that equation: the efforts of the teachers, and the eager reception of
          the students. Formation of character begins at home and it is a blessing to be able to appreciate a continuation
          of the instillment of those values at school.  For example, many of us find comfort in the structure of the day
          which begins and ends with prayer -- a reflection of the ideal prayer life that many of us were taught to maintain
          from a young age. Our uniting faith is the backbone of our community.  And although opportunities for mass,
          adoration, service, the March For Life, and religious retreats present themselves as obvious examples of the
          breadth of our Salesian community, the most resonating demonstrations of virtuous practice have been student led
          efforts, both spontaneous and deliberate.

            This year, in the wake of tragedy, the student body as a whole, but especially through the leadership of our class,
              came together to offer focused prayers for the lives lost in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Shooting.



            We came together in tremendous support for one of our classmates and his family after a tragic loss.



            And not shortly after, you came together in tremendous support again, for me and my family.
              And I cannot thank you enough for that.



            This is not just a graduating class of a Catholic school.  This is a community of individuals who embody the
          characteristics espoused by the prayers and practices we share; who will support each other in times of need;
          who go out of our way for each other; who resemble a family more than a class.

            Rather than adopt an approach of resignation in the face of any of these obstacles, we have demonstrated courage.
          Courage to not only carry on, but to lift up those around us as well in our pursuit of success, whether it be
          moral, academic, athletic, or spiritual.  And while we are responsible for maintaining this strength within our
          community, it would be quite an exaggeration to claim that it began with our class.

            According to the blurb from the website, our school was “[founded in] 1964” - meaning that we are the 50th
          graduating class of  since the inaugural graduating class of 1968, many members of whom are
          joining us here today.  The approach of the alumni who first walked in, and first walked out, of the familiar
          doors of  are reminiscent of the Old Testament figure of Abraham (and not because he lived to be
          175 years old). Abraham, the Sojourner of the Unknown, is the manifestation of several ideals present within a
          good role model, including courage.  However, he was not without sin, not by a long shot (and thank goodness
          for that, right?).  Yet, he was arguably the most successful protagonist of the Old Testament: Holder of the
          Covenant, Father of Nations, Master of the Unknown.

            In the book of Genesis, we learn how Abraham responded to the divine instruction of God, dropped everything,
          and travelled to the foreign land of Canaan.  He rescued his nephew, Lot, from tribal warlords in the land of
          Sodom with only 318 men of his house.  He bartered with God in an attempt to prevent the destruction of Sodom
          if only 10 good men could be found within the corrupt city.  Abraham became the leader of what was once the
          foreign land of Canaan, and established his house as a beacon of followers of God: partakers in the covenant.

            An excerpt from the book of Hebrews chapter 11, verse 9, reads: “By faith he made his home in the promised
          land like a stranger in a foreign country;” The Story of Abraham --who entered into strange lands, mastered
          them, and lifted up those within them-- is not dissimilar to the story of the Class of 1968 who we are pleased
          to celebrate our graduation ceremony with today.

            Now, most of us came into high school knowing nothing about anything, let alone what to expect for the next four
          years of our academic careers.  I was homeschooled through the 8th grade, but I still don’t think that I can
          fully relate to the sense of foreignness that the Class of ‘68 must have experienced.  They entered into a
          brand new school, a clean slate, a “foreign land.”  There was no mascot, no school colors, no traditions,
          no community.  Not only did the Class of 1968 experience the full degree of the “unknown” that must have
          permeated the walls of the school 50 years ago, but they embraced it; They voluntarily sought it out, many of
          them paying for their own tuition working multiple jobs on the side.

            I’d like to think that I had a pretty solid freshman year: participated in a few clubs, got good grades,
          got a varsity Letter, you know --but I didn’t literally invent the school’s culture from the ground up while
          working 20 hours a week, all while making the Honor Roll.  However, several of the alumni amongst you today did
          just that.  The Abrahamic attitude of courage to embrace the unknown is personified by their attitude and
          approach towards the unknown.  Among them are Nuclear Engineers, Entrepreneurs, Computer Scientists, Businessmen,
          and Outstanding Fathers and Husbands.  Each of them shares the common characteristic of courage.  Courage to
          walk in the land of the unknown (I think it’s called the Oblate House now), and to lead the way for all
          subsequent classes.

            They made some of their best friends at , and, in just four years, established a community that has
          lasted a lifetime, and continues to serve those who are fortunate enough to participate in it as well.  That’s
          us: the direct beneficiaries of the efforts of the Class of 1968.  And for that, I think that they are very
          deserving of a round of applause...  While, compared to being stranded in the desert for 40 years, high school
          is a pretty trivial “foreign land” --still well within the confines of safety and inherent goodness-- the
          underlying theme of voluntarily choosing that which is unsettled, unproved … that which is unknown, has been
          ingrained into the culture of the  Community from the outset, and I have see it evidenced through the
          efforts of the Class of 2018 everyday.

            Modernist author of the 20th Century William Faulkner said “You cannot swim for new horizons until you have
          the courage to lose sight of the shore.”  Now that we’ve graduated, and we know everything, it’s time to depart
          from the familiarity of the shore, and conquer the new horizons.  It’s time to conquer the unknown.  For the
          overwhelming majority of us, the most immediate horizon will be college.  And to be honest, I’m not too worried
          about college.  If we were able to memorize the quadratic formula, the role of the RNA in protein synthesis,
          all the effects of the Sacraments, and all the Amendments -- then how much harder can college really be… right?

            No, the thing which would concern me, and which will persist throughout the rest of my life, is my ability to
          maintain the positive characteristics I would attribute to my time at . To continue to be a good person.
          But thanks to the values of discipline, integrity, and work ethic, as well as my Catholic faith, all of which were
          solidified over the past four years, I’m not concerned to face the future.  In fact, I’m excited to lose sight of
          the shore and swim for new horizons, because I know that when the waters get choppy, as they inevitably will,
          I’ll have a lifeline to you, my classmates.  The past four years have seen some of our best achievements, but
          we’re just getting started.

          Continue to be thankful, continue to be prayerful, and continue to be courageous.

          "Oh, and one last thing: Caps in five baby!"
                    //Although perhaps an immature and primal reference towards the hockey team which hadn't made the playoffs
                    let alone the championship in my lifetime, this ad-lib drastically augmented the electricity and teenage spirit
                    of the otherwise mature speech which had been delivered.  It was welcomed with a roar of support.  Whether for me
                    or for the team was irrelevant to me at that moment.  Crackling with residual emotion from my preceding speech and
                    the positive response with which it was recieved, I returned to my seat, with a grind that I only wish I had been able to share.


              Thank You

    It does not accrete around you.
      Rarely is it stumbled upon or acquired by happenstance.
        It is not achievable alone.

      if wise men refuse it other will not." --John Adams

    And we will all be poorer for it.

    Desire for success must be vertical effort which cannot be suppressed.
      It must be a fire.

    Entropy of the mind is the downfall of man and the wrong stranger to welcome under your roof.
      Distraction is the fuel of failure.
    It is so much easier to neglect the task at hand.
      To give up.
        To run.
    Than it is to push onward and upwards to the goal.  To be better than the last, whether that be the last interpretation
      of your own efforts, or the physical iterations of those who preceded you on your journey.

    Nevertheless: persevere.

    "Never let a crisis go to waste" --Gates  & "Nothing focuses the mind like a hanging" --Samuel Johnson

    Be sincere in your opportunism. Emerge closer to your goal than before.

      He who does not know the ins an outs of every fiber of the obstacle --whether it be sentient or merely present--
        must yield to ignorance.  Ignorance is able to be overcome, quite easily in comparison to other obstacles which midnight

          Do not fail on account of a predictable and usurpable impediment.

          Fulfillment, purpose, meaning, salvation require that you be industrious and clever in your achievement of

    "We are what we run from." --M&R.L. Need to Know

    Do not be defined by that which you are neglecting, running from.


Fix it.


    Hold accountability, towards others and yourself.

    If necessary, "relegate them to an empty office or basement"

    Candor is necessary.  Never lie to your subordinates.  Empower and guide them.

    Manipulation and patronage are antithetical to a successful legacy.
      The mark of a good leader is defined by the continued success of an institution in the leader's absence.

    "Legacy is the fundamental mark of success of any leader.  Continuity of an empire or enterprise denotes
    wit not only in the short term, but in the long term." --P.J. Gates

    That he should be succeeded by one who not only matched his own capability, but surpassed it was the mission,
      the purpose of his existence.  Of anyone's existence.

    "For if he sets forth a righteous goal, an ideal, a result which ought to be striven for even if only for the
      sake of progress itself, and furthermore dedicates himself not only to its development, but the expedient
        transfer of authority from himself to he successor, that he might also pursue the goal, ideal, or progression
          of excellence: it is he who has led a full life."

    This might be critiqued a a 'capitalist' understanding of the purpose of life.  However if may be countered,
      via comparison of Friedman, Schrodinger, and Karl Marx, that this supposition bears its own truth by the
        examination of the efficacy of an individual member of society, independent of the influences of either
          of the aforementioned ideologies and their branching sub-influences.



  [Schrödinger, Friedman, and Karl Marx]

  Until you examine each individual within a community, it is impossible to gauge the capability or degree of agreeableness
    with the 'socialistic' ideology set forth.

  Therefore, it is most logical to initiate the mantra of the 'tribe' as it may be referred to with an individualistic
    approach which dictates that each man (in the sense of referring to a single person, devoid of any gendered connotation),
      is entitled to his own pursuit of happiness.
  Drawing from the ideas of Locke, it is fair to assume that each man, at the core of his inner-most motivations, desires primarily
    to advance himself. .......develop

  BS therefore it is reasonable to conclude that in light of the obstacle of holistically assessing each member of any given
    society's cooperativeness with regard to an ideology such as socialism (or any other derivative ideology) is inferior in
      comparison to the freedom permitted by a capitalist approach which respect individual freedoms, rights, and liberties.

  Especially important is the fact that each individual (or congregation of like minded individuals) is permitted to organize
   him or themselves according to alternative ideologies, whereas under almost any other governing belief system (perhaps
    excluding that of zen contrarianism), such diversification of practice would be prohibited.  Therein lies the beauty of
      such a system governed by freedom primarily and limited external interference.

  Liberalism, the antidote...||-/

    "When a man assumes the public trust, he should consider himself as public property" --Jefferson

    Honor and Integrity are constant propositions.

    "It is a simple truth that when you are talking you are not learning." --Bob Woodward

    Let this statement be countered by the truth that teaching is one of the most drastic means by which
      one demonstrates a greater knowledge of some skill.

    If you are able to fully transfer knowledge of one thing to another person (which usually require talking),
      then you may be relegated to the ranks of one who has learned that very skill.

    That being said, at times it is crucial that you just shut the hell up.

    Silence can in fact be weaponized.  When in a position of power, no matter how slight,
        a dialogue marked by your own intentional reservation towards betraying your own ends
          often results in a lengthy confession by those who are subjected to such a meditated
            withdrawal of provocation.

    Listen.
      Encourage constructive dissent.
        Arrogance is born out of assumed infallibility.

    Re-establish the domain of your control with the acquisition of your goal in mind.

    "Just because somethings are not forbidden does not mean that they are permissible." --Gates

    There will be grey areas requiring immediate action with moral implications.
      Formation of the conscience, of the person, is a constant proposition.

    "When you come into the presence of a leader of men,
      you know you have come into the presence of fire
        --that it is best not incautiously to touch that man--
          that there is something that makes it dangerous to cross him." --Woodrow Wilson

    Success is a constantly challenged proposition

    Because life is a constantly opposed gauntlet



"Profiles in Courage"

  Every decision for something is a decision against something else.
    A decision against sloth
    Or perhaps one that propels you towards vice.

  Volition defines our approach to these otherwise unpleasant realities.

  Even an approach which is resented, but willfully undertaken, supersedes the approach which is compelled
    because it contains at least some grain of courage within.

  An approach defined by compulsion will spoil the journey and result of the task at hand.

  "We fought for reasons which are perhaps shameful, but are, in the end, stronger than any doctrine.
   We fought for ourselves...We fought like rats which do not hesitate to spring with all their teeth
   bared when they are cornered by a man infinitely larger than they are." --Guy Sajer

   "Choking back tears, I prayed, without reason or thought, saying anything that came into my head...
   But God did not answer my appeals...The man struggled with death, and the adolescent struggled with despair,
   which is close to death.  And God, who watches everything did nothing." --GS

    • I would not only be incapable of my success, but incapable of being able to help give back to my community,

      towards which this epigraph is oriented.  Words cannot describe, no matter how numerous or sophisticated
        the virtuosity of this woman.

     First campaign I ran tiny little

     named McGuthrie. Had no money, no
     staff, no fuckin office. Everyone
     thought we didn't stand a chance.
     There's no way we can compete. And
     about this time, a guy running a
     congressional campaign a few
     districts over gives me a call.
     Says, "I really like what you were
     able to do for poor ole' Sam. But
     let's face it, he's a goner, so why
     don't you come work for me?" What
     do I do? Well Stephen -this is
     where you and I are different. I
     told Sam about the call. And Sam
     says to me, "Paul, you think this
     other's guy's got a shot at
     winning, and he can pay you more
     than anything I can afford, so if
     it's what you feel you need to do,
     then I won't get in your way." So I
     say, "Sam -you took a chance and
     hired me when I was even more of
     nobody than you are, and I'd be
     damned if I'm gonna jump ship just
     because the shit hit the fan."
     We lost the race, but three years
     later, when Sam decided to run for
     Governor -who do you think he
     called? We won that race.



     fuck.


     loyalty over skill.


     family over everything.


     and of course our hearts go out to them... it's hard to imagine what they're going through...

     You always hear people talking about events out of sequence...the order of things.

      Father, you ask us to accept God's plan, to not question his judgment, with all due respect,
     I don't accept this judgment. He made the world better, not just for me, but for everyone he touched.

     One day we'll grab a beer and
           you'll tell me

      You should be able to hear them...do you hear them?

      fuck

     They sat on the edge of the pier, looking out over the slate ripples which reflected the lights of the nearby high rises,
   gently distorting the colorful streaks coming from across the bay.  Silently wondering what she would say, he sat pensively,
   arms folded inwards between his legs, his gaze bouncing across the water which lapped up to occasionally splash the edge of
   the cement at his feet.  It was a hot summer night, and his discomfort increased with each passing minute as he questioned his
   own words.

   "So, what now?" She asked.

   2.

     He squinted as his muffled alarm sounded from beneath his pillow.  Begrudgingly swinging his legs out of the bed, he tossed the
   disarray of blankets towards the edge of the bed where the frame met the wall.

     He didn't remember most of the day.  His attention wavered in and out as he passed through the hallways looking at his feet.

     "I won't be in class this Friday, so you are to work on finalizing your projects which are due Monday before the start of class.
   I'm going to visit my father."  The instructor's voice wavered momentarily.  Then, gathering herself, she continued "...My mother
   fell down the stairs and is not doing well.  I need to be with my family, I'm sure you understand."

     He stared at his desk as his hands trembled.  Tears welled in his eyes as he thought of his own mother: home, alone.

     When he got home, he immediately collapsed into his unmade bed which had remained in a state of chaotic negligence for several weeks
   now.  He awoke to the annoyed voice of his own mom, calling him down for dinner.  Lists of tasks fell from his absent-minded focus at
   the dinner table, just as easily as they had entered.  Penning a few final distracted responses onto a peace of loose leaf which he unceremoniously
   tossed into his bag, he rolled back into bed.

     As he tossed and turned, now unable to sleep, his mind fell, once again, to the monotony of the routine he had adopted in the past two
   months: wake up, go to work, go to sleep.  Wake up, go to work, go to sleep. Wake up,...

   3.

     He awoke the next day, several minutes later than his alarm had prompted.  He rushed to get dressed without knowing why he cared if he
   was late.  The day passed with no notable dissimilarity to the last.  Or the one before it, or the one before it either.

   Wake up.
     Go to work.
       Go to sleep.

   repeat.

     An expensive-looking boat cruised across the bay towards the bridge, blaring obnoxiously loud music that could easily be heard over
   the splashes of the water which lapped against the pier and the chatter which emanated from the surrounding restaurants.  After the boat
   passed out of ear shot, and after another drawn out minute as he searched in vain for the right words, he opened his mouth to speak, but
   then closed it.  She turned her head towards him and raised an inquisitive eye brow.

     "I don't know... Go home, go to sleep, wake up, go to work, go to sleep." He looked away sheepishly as her mouth turned
   downwards ever so slightly, disapproving of his prescription without overtly expressing her dissatisfaction towards it.

     A moment passed and then she said "That doesn't change anything though...What's that supposed to do?"

     They looked back out over the water towards the pretty lights.  Her arm trembled against his--and then pulled away.  He himself
   felt a twang of annoyance within; she had pedantically criticized his sheepish statement and he became upset that he had even suggested
   it in the first place.  Several more minutes transpired in a silent stalemate as each pondered the terse dialogue that had consisted
   of fewer than fifty words, yet occupied as many minutes.  He considered her response, becoming increasingly frustrated with himself at its
   truth and the following implication regarding his own routine unfolded in his mind.  He opened his mouth, but then shut it again as a
   couple strolled down the pier past their bench.  After they had passed back towards the garbled laughs and cheers which reached his ears
   from the harbor and its attractions, he gathered his thoughts, once again, and, breathing shakily, he said,

     "I was going to defend my statement, because that's all I've been doing for the past five months, but I realized you were right.
     It doesn't change anything."

     He looked away as tears rolled down his warm cheeks.  He felt foolish as she held his hand in a confused attempt to console him.
   He had been planning this evening, this conversation, for weeks, except he had expected to be the resolute participant in the conversation,
   comforting her as she mumbled weak suggestions towards his impassive direction.  Instead, it was him.

     He thought that he had become hardened by his indifference towards the disparities between the days that had passed.  Unmoved and
   unfeeling; moving from one day to the next with courage.  However, as he sat on the bench, weeping silently, ashamed, he
   realized how false that image of himself really was.

     The drive back to her house was marked by an understandably uncomfortable silence.  As he pulled into her driveway and unbuckled his
   seatbelt, she turned and said, "You don't have to walk me to the door."  She strode up the walkway, opened the door, and disappeared inside
   without turning back.

     The wind blasted his eyes as he sped home, arriving much later than he said he would.

     "Did you have fun?" His mom sleepily inquired?
     "Yup, gnight." He replied.

     Kicking back the sheets which fell off the bed entirely, he lay staring through the dark towards the ceiling, crying silently.

     Go to sleep.
       Wake up.
         Go to work.
           Wake up.

  "It is tempting to be angry at the loss of someone who brought so much
  happiness into the world, to shake our fists and demand to know how
  God could take him away. I prefer to be thankful to God for sharing
  such a gift at all, even if the time was too short.  The lives of
  anyone who knew [him] are far richer for it."
